  <Description>
The transmuted creature can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the creature's normal speed.
 
A strong wind (21+ mph) can push an air walker along or hold her back. At the end of her turn each round, the wind blows her 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or suffering physical damage from being buffeted about.
 
You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You train a mount to air walk with the Handle Animal skill (air walking counts as an unusual task).

  <Description>
Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature who speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.
 
Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within a mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
 
Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away. The ringing lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.
 
Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm unless the intruder becomes material while in the warded area.

  <Description>
You can alter your appearance and form-including clothing and equipment-to appear taller or shorter, thin, fat, or in between. The assumed form must be corporeal. Your body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs, and your weight can be changed up to one-half. If the form selected has wings, you can fly at a speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. If the form has gills, you can breathe underwater.
 
Your attack rolls, natural armor bonus, and saves do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms of the chosen form. Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. If you are slain, you automatically return to your normal form.
 
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.

  <Description>
You discern spells and magical properties present in a creature or object. One property, spell, or power is revealed each round, from lowest level (or weakest power) to highest (or strongest). For each spell or power, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result is equal to or higher than the spell's or power's caster level, you identify it. Otherwise, you fail to identify that spell or power, and you can check for the next one next round.
 
Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact.
 
After you analyze one object or creature, the spell ends, even if its duration has not expired yet. Casting this spell is physically taxing; you must make a Fortitude save (DC 21) when the spell ends or be exhausted and unable to do anything but rest for the next 1d8 hours.

You win the loyalty of an animal, provided that your heart is true. The spell functions only if you actually wish to be the animal's friend. If you are not willing to treat the animal as a friend (for example, you intend to eat it, or to use it to set off traps), the spell fails. An animal's loyalty, once gained, is natural (not magical) and lasting.
 
You can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are coming when called, rolling over on command, fetching, or shaking hands. They cannot be complex (complex tricks, such as accepting a rider, require the Handle Animal skill).
 
At any one time, you can have only a certain number of animals befriended to you. You can have animal friends whose Hit Dice total no more than twice your caster level. You may dismiss animal friends to enable you to befriend new ones.

  <Description>
A number of animals grow to twice their normal size. This doubles each animal's height, length, and width, increasing its weight by a factor of eight. This increase in size has a number of effects:
 
Hit Dice: The creature's HD double, doubling the creature's base attack bonus and increasing its saves accordingly.
 
Size: The creature's size increases one step. This increase reduces its AC (according to the new size), reduces its attack bonus (according to the new size), affects its ability to grapple, and so on. The creature gains an enlargement bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, and its damage with natural attacks increases. This spell does not affect Colossal creatures.
 
When the spell ends, the creature's hit points return to normal, and all damage the creature has taken while enlarged is divided by 2.
 
The spell gives you no special means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.

  <Description>
You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get the animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else.
 
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain or mouth of a nearby river). The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. 
 
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. Note that unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored. The intended recipient of a message gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's in a language she doesn't know, for example).
 
The spell works only on animals with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2.

  <Description>
As polymorph other, except you polymorph up to one willing creature per level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or you dismiss the spell for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume her normal form (as a full-round action); doing so ends the spell for her and her alone.
 
The allowed size of the animal form depends on your level:
 &lt;pre&gt;Caster Level	Allowed Sizes ------------	-------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Up to 16th	Small or Medium-size 17th-19th	Tiny through Large 20th		Diminutive through Huge&lt;/pre&gt; 
Creatures polymorphed by this spell don't suffer the disorientation penalty that those transformed by polymorph other often do.

Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals, beasts, and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be affected by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD that you entrance. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.
 
Animals trained to attack or guard, beasts, and magical beasts are allowed saving throws; animals not trained to attack or guard are not. An entranced creature can be struck (with a +2 bonus to the attack roll, as if it were stunned), but it then recovers from the compulsion and is no longer affected by the spell.

  <Description>
This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken commands. The skeletons or zombies can follow you, or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.)
 
Regardless of the type of undead, you can't create more HD of undead than you have caster levels with a single casting of animate dead.
 
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
 
Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones (so purple worm skeletons are not allowed). If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.
 
Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The creature must have a true anatomy (so gelatinous cube zombies are not allowed). The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.

The animated object can be of any nonmagical material-wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. You can also animate masses of raw matter, such as water, a rock from a wall or a rock on the ground, as long as the volume of material does not exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level.
 
The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

  <Description>
You can animate a nonliving ropelike object, including string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the total length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase the length by 50% for each reduction of the rope's width by half. The possible commands are "Coil" (form a neat, coiled stack), "Coil and knot," "Loop," "Loop and knot," "Tie and knot," and the opposites of all of the above ("Uncoil," etc.). One command can be given each round as a standard action.
 
The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it-it does not snake outward-so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll. The rope has a range increment of 10 feet. A typical rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and can be burst with a Strength check (DC 23). The rope does not deal damage of any type, but it can be used as a trip line or to entangle a single opponent who fails a Reflex saving throw. An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the rope can anchor itself to an immobile object, the entangled creature cannot move. Otherwise, it can move at half speed but can't run or charge. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with an Escape Artist check (DC 20).
 
The rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are not magical. 
 
This spell grants a +2 bonus to any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.

  <Description>
An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
 
An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.
 
Golems and other magical constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an antimagic area (though the antimagic area suppresses their supernatural, spell-like, and spell abilities normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.
 
Summoned or conjured creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that's maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a conjured creature who has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's SR to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by the antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
 
Normal creatures can enter the area, as can normal missiles. The spell has no effect on constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Undead and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.
 
Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
 
Note: Should you be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of your person that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.

  <Description>
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific type of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically-for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, cloakers, or vampires. Larger groups, such as "goblinoids," are not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named-for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or true neutral.
 
Creatures of the designated type or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature who makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item, but feels very uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.
 
Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy.
 
This spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.

The antiplant shell spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures whom the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.

  <Description>
You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. The arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The arcane eye sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of an arcane eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (1 inch in diameter).
 
You must concentrate to use the eye. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items (though you can use magic to improve your own eyesight). You are subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel magic cast on you or the eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and other phenomena that affect vision, the arcane eye is considered an independent sensory organ of yours. (For example, it is not blinded if your normal eyes are blinded.)
 
Any creature with Intelligence 12 or higher can notice the arcane eye by making a Scry check or an Intelligence check (DC 20). Spells such as detect scrying can also detect the eye.

Add +10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. Note that a knock spell does not remove an arcane lock. It only suppresses it for 10 minutes.

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can be no taller than 6 inches in height and consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harm to the material upon which the mark is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible (though not necessarily understandable). See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows their users to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If cast on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the mark to fade in about a month.
 
Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting Drawmij's instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details).

  <Description>
Freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body into another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other creatures with you, provided the creatures are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever you left them.
 
You project your astral self into the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. You then leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
 
When on the Astral Plane or another plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and materially. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
 
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to their physical bodies. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

  <Description>
This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity at the cost of 500 experience points in order to expunge the subject's burden. Naturally, many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine if the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.
 
Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected:
 
Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
 
Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to unwillingly or unwittingly committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Note: A paladin who willingly and deliberately commits an evil act can never regain her paladinhood.
 
Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost his ability to cast spells because he incurred the anger of his deity may regain his spell powers by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
 
Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders (or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally).
 
Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (NPCs). This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.

An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.
 
The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that the question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;"Weal" (if the action will probably bring good         results).&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;"Woe" (for bad results).&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;"Weal and woe" (for both).&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;"Nothing" (for actions that don't have         especially good or bad results).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it resulted from a failed or successful augury.
 
The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the augury. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic within half an hour use the same dice result as the first augury.

You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the target's HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).
 
The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.
 
An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all 3d6. Awakened plants gain the ability to move their limbs, roots, vines, creepers, etc., and have senses similar to a human's.
 
An awakened animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD.
 
An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

To target a creature, you must present at least one object or substance that it hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain +1 on your caster level check to overcome the target's SR (if any) and +2 on the saving throw DC.
 
At the DM's option, certain rare items might work twice as well (each providing +2 against SR and +4 on the spell's DC).

Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.
 
The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +11 for the hand's Strength score (33), -1 for being Large. The hand's damage is 1d8+12, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell's save DC) or be stunned for 1 round.

Bigby's interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing nine-tenths cover (+10 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt to hide or disguise himself. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
 
A Bigby's hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you when undamaged, and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys the hand.
 
Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. If the opponent weighs more than 2,000 pounds, the hand cannot reduce its speed but still affects the opponent's attacks.
 
By concentrating (as a standard action), you can designate a new opponent for the hand.

You may have up to six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of the spell increases by +1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your effective level increases by a number equal to one-third that assistant's level (provided the target is appropriate for the spell). All the assistants must join in chanting the spell (see the details on the spell's verbal component, below). Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding durations are dismissible.
 
The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.
 
Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. Duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
 
Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for up to one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.
 
Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per caster level. Reduce save DC by 2.
 
Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The spell is permanent. Reduce save DC by 3.
 
Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent (your choice). The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce save DC by 4.
 
Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem or similar object or jar. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce save DC by 4.
 
Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire (but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass). The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, or hit points don't qualify. For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by +2 and increases the cost of the spell's material components by one-half (see below).
 
In the case of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect (the durations overlap). If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration (even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw). If the creature succeeds at this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.
 
Components: Specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), plus the spell requires gems worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target.

This spell creates a spinning disk of razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around a central point, creating an immobile, circular barrier. Any creature passing through the blade barrier takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The plane of rotation of the blades can be horizontal, vertical, or slanted.
 
Creatures within the blade barrier when it is invoked take the damage as well. They can negate the damage with a successful Reflex saving throw, provided they can and do physically leave the area of the blades by the shortest possible route. Once the barrier is in place, anything entering or passing through the blades automatically takes damage.
 
A blade barrier serves as one-half cover (+4 AC) for anyone beyond it.

Uttering blasphemy creates two effects.
 
If you are on your home plane, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the blasphemy.
 
Creatures native to your plane who hear the blasphemy and are not evil suffer the following ill effects:
 &lt;pre&gt;HD		Effect --		------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;12 or more	Dazed Less than 12	Weakened, dazed Less than 8	Paralyzed, weakened, dazed Less than 4	Killed&lt;/pre&gt; 
The effects are cumulative.
 
Dazed: The creature is dazed and can take no actions for 1 round (but defends itself normally).
 
Weakened: The creature's Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds.
 
Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.
 
Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

All critical rolls against evil foes are automatically successful (so every threat is a critical hit). The weapon negates the damage reduction of evil creatures and is capable of striking evil incorporeal creatures as if it had a +1 enhancement bonus. Also, the weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures. Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.
 
This transmutation can't affect any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.

  <Description>
The blink effect rapidly cycles you in and out of the ethereal plane. Blinking has several effects:
 
Physical attacks suffer a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help (since the blinker is ethereal and not merely invisible). If the attack is capable of striking ethereal or incorporeal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for one-half concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. If the attacker can both see and strike ethereal creatures, he suffers no penalty. Likewise, your own attacks suffer a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
 
Individually targeted spells have a 50% chance to fail against you while blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Likewise, your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
 
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (or full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (+2 attack), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You suffer only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
 
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there's a 50% chance that you become material, with regrettable consequences (see below). You can move only at three-quarters speed: Movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.
 
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. 
 
An ethereal creature who becomes material while in a material object is shunted off to the nearest open space and takes 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.

  <Description>
This dispelling spell frees creatures from enchantments, transmutations, curses, and petrification (as well as other magical transformations). Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as flesh to stone. For each such effect, you make a check of 1d20 + caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For cursed magic items, the DC is 25.
 
If the spell is one that, as a special property, cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
 
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item but merely frees the victim from the item's effects, leaving the item cursed.

To cast call lightning, you must be in a stormy area---a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 HD or more). You are then able to evoke bolts of lightning as long as you remain in the stormy area. (The spell ends if you leave the stormy area.) You can call down one bolt every 10 minutes. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately---other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, you must use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call each bolt. A bolt causes 1d10 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 10d10).
 
The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose, within range (measured from your position at the time). The bolt takes the shortest possible unobstructed path between a nearby cloud and the target. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes is affected.
 
This spell can be used only outdoors. It does not function indoors, underground, or underwater.

Animals trained to attack or guard, dire animals, beasts, and magical beasts are allowed saving throws. Animals not trained to attack or guard are not.
 
The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat (fire, a hungry predator, an imminent attack) breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but this spell can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive, except to protect themselves. Any aggressive action or life-threatening damage against calmed creatures immediately breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.
 
This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) mind-affecting spells such as bless, confusion, emotion, and fear, as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage. While the calm emotions spell lasts, a suppressed spell has no effect. When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell takes hold of the creature again, provided its duration has not expired in the meantime.

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.
 
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) on the primary target. After the bolt strikes, lightning can arc to as many secondary targets as you have levels. The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as many dice of damage as the primary (rounded down). All subjects can attempt Reflex saving throws for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).

  <Description>
You make yourself---including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment---look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. For example, a human caster could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or look like an entirely different person.
 
The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe.
 
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.
 
Note: Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with it (such as by touching you and having that not match what they see, in this case of this spell).

  <Description>
You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature who looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have suffered the last time it appeared.

You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of  a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.
 
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures and staggers them for 1d6 rounds. A staggered character can take only partial actions. A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the stagger effect.
 
The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not staggered. They can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

This charm makes a humanoid of Medium-size or smaller regard you as his trusted friend and ally. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, he receives a +5 bonus on his saving throw.
 
The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if he were an automaton, but he perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince him to do anything he wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. Note also that you must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

  <Description>
Chill metal makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Enchanted metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw (unless its own is higher).
 
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it's holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
 
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes very chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage (this is also the effect on the last round of the spell's duration). During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown below:
 &lt;pre&gt;Round 	Temperature Damage ----- 	----------- ------ 1 	Cold None 2 	Icy 1d4 points 3-5 	Freezing 2d4 points 6 	Icy 1d4 points 7 	Cold None&lt;/pre&gt; 
Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the creature plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no chill damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.
 
Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal.

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage and possibly also 1 point of temporary Strength damage. (A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage.) You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.
 
The spell has a special effect on undead creatures. Undead touched by you suffer no damage or Strength loss, but they must make successful Will saving throws or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.

Clairaudience/clairvoyance enables you to concentrate upon some locale and hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known---a place familiar to you or an obvious one (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The spell does not allow magically enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Lead sheeting or magical protection (such as antimagic field, mind blank, or nondetection) blocks the spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked. The spell creates an invisible sensor, similar to that created by a scrying spell, that can be dispelled. The spell functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and confusing lawful creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects:
 
First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus to saves. Unlike protection from law, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.
 
Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.
 
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from law does.
 
Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds with a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is confused for 1 round (Will save negates, as confusion, but against the save DC of cloak of chaos).

This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, the original's soul transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original has reached the end of its natural life span (died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
 
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) taken from the original's living body, with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (such as by the gentle repose spell). Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
 
When the clone is completed, if the original is dead, the original's soul enters the clone. The clone has the personality, memories, skills, and levels the original had at the time the piece of flesh was taken. However, the replacement must be at least one level lower than the original was at the time of death. If the original was 1st level, the clone's Constitution score drops by 1; if this would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is at the level at which the original died.
 
The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.
 
A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting creature is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not somehow preserved.

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud except that its vapors are ghastly yellowish green and poisonous. They kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save) and cause creatures with 4 to 6 HD to make Fortitude saving throws or die. Living creatures above 6 HD, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD who make their saving throws, take 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the cloud. Holding one's breath doesn't help. 
 
Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. (Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.) Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

A vivid cone of intertwined, clashing colors springs forth from your hand, stunning creatures, blinding them, or even knocking them unconscious. The closest 1d6 creatures in the cone are affected. The spell affects each subject according to its HD:
 
Up to 2: Unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then blinded for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)
 
3 or 4: Blinded for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.
 
5 or more: Stunned for 1 round.
 
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.
 
A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it.
 
Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray.

You give the subject a one-word command, which she obeys to the best of her ability. A very reasonable command causes the subject to suffer a penalty on the saving throw (from -1 to -4, at the DM's discretion). Typical commands are "Flee," "Die" (which causes the subject to feign death), "Halt," "Run," "Stop," "Fall," "Go," "Leave," "Surrender," and "Rest." (A command of "Suicide" fails because "suicide" is generally used as a noun, not as a command.)

Plants, fungi, plant creatures, and fungus creatures do your bidding.
 
Charm: Against plant creatures and fungus creatures, command plants functions as a mass charm spell. You can command a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed three times your level (or at least one creature regardless of HD). No two affected creatures can be more than 30 feet from each other, and each is allowed a Will saving throw to negate the effect. Spell resistance applies. The effect lasts 1 day per caster level. This is a charm effect.
 
Animate: The spell imbues trees or other large, inanimate vegetable life with mobility. The animated plants then attack whomever or whatever you first designate. Animated plants gain humanlike senses. The plants' AC, speed, attacks, and special abilities vary with their size and form, as described for animated objects in the Monster Manual. You can animate two trees, four shrubs, or eight vines. All plants to be affected must be within 60 feet of each other. You can animate different types of plants if desired (for example, one tree and four vines or a tree and two shrubs). Creatures who have the plants in their possession can prevent the effect with Will saves or spell resistance. The effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.
 
Entangle: You imbue all plants within range with semimobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This duplicates the effect of an entangle spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. The effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

You contact your deity---or agents thereof---and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. "Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM should give a short phrase (five words or less) as an answer instead. The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting. 
 
In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of one mile per caster level. In natural underground settings---caves, caverns, etc. the range is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement (such as in dungeons and towns).

  <Description>
You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages (such as writing in another language). In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. Note that the ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. Note also that the spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.
 
Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

Creatures affected by this spell behave randomly, as indicated on the following table:
 &lt;pre&gt;1d10 	Behavior ---- 	-------- 1 	Wander away for 1 minute (unless prevented) 2-6 	Do nothing for 1 round 7-9 	Attack nearest creature for 1 round 10 	Act normally for 1 round&lt;/pre&gt; 
Except on a result of 1, roll again each round to see what the subject does that round. Wandering creatures leave the scene as if disinterested. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking them. Behavior is checked at the beginning of each creature's turn. Any confused creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn.

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. All Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area gain a +3 sacred bonus. Undead entering this area suffer minor disruption, giving them a -1 sacred penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area.
 
If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers listed above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to turning, -2 penalty to undead rolls). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron.
 
Consecrate counters and dispels desecrate.

You send your mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.)

Avoid Effective Intelligence/Charisma Decrease: You must succeed at an Intelligence check against this DC in order to avoid effective Intelligence and Charisma decrease. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. (The entries in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate Elemental Plane.)
 
Results of a Successful Contact: The DM rolls d% for the result shown on the table:
 
True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions not capable of being answered in this way are answered randomly.
 
Don't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.
 
Lie: The entity intentionally lies to you.
 
Random Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.
 
The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (The DM answers all questions with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer.) You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question.
 
You can contact an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability of suffering an effective decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to DM changes, the personalities of individual deities, and so on.)
 
On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

  <Description>
You can place another spell upon your person so that the latter spell comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. The companion spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that casting time instead.
 
The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so forth) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
 
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
 
You can use only one contingency spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

  <Description>
You can converse, in very rudimentary terms, with all sorts of plants and plantlike creatures (including fungi, molds, and plantlike monsters such as shambling mounds). You automatically exercise limited control over normal plants. Plantlike creatures can negate the control effect with a Will save.
 
The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but it does allow them to move their branches, stems, and leaves. Thus, you can question plants as to whether or not creatures have passed through them, cause thickets to part to enable easy passage, require vines to entangle pursuers, and command similar services.
 
The plants can duplicate the effect of an entangle spell or free creatures trapped by that spell.

This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice. Telepathic communication is not possible, but the creatures understand you no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for instance), the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the controlled undead revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent undead remember that you controlled them.

Depending on the version you choose, the control water spell raises or lowers water.
 
Lower Water: This causes water (or similar liquid) to sink away to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet per caster level. The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell. The spell has no effect on other creatures.
 
Raise Water: This causes water (or similar liquid) to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land near the raised water, the water can spill over onto dry land.
 
For either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

  <Description>
You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. The current, natural weather conditions are determined by the DM. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.
 &lt;pre&gt;Season 	Possible Weather ------ 	----------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Spring 	Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet 	storm, or hot weather Summer 	Torrential rain, heat wave, or 	hailstorm Autumn 	Hot or cold weather, fog, or 	sleet Winter 	Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw&lt;/pre&gt; 
You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather---where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously---fog and strong wind, for example.
 
Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.
 
Druids casting this spell double the duration and affect a circle with a three-mile radius.

You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an "eye" of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the effect to any circular area less than your full range (for example, a 20-foot-diameter tornado centered 100 feet away).
 
Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal         strength in all directions.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the         center in equal strength from all directions, veering         upward before impinging on the eye in the center.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in         clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction         across the entire area from one side to the other.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
Wind Force: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Each round, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect.
 
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage. A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder. A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.

The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. The water doesn't go bad as the food does.

As create undead, except that this spell allows you to create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead. The type of undead created is based on your level. The following types of undead can be created by casters of the specified levels:
 &lt;pre&gt;Cleric Level 	Undead Created ------------ 	--------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;15 or lower 	Mummy 16-17 		Spectre 18-19 		Vampire 20 		Ghost*&lt;/pre&gt; 
*Ghosts created by this spell have three ghostly powers in addition to manifestation: malevolence, horrific appearance, and corrupting gaze.
 
You may attempt to command the undead as it forms with a turning check.
 
Certain types of undead, such as liches, cannot be created by this spell. Such undead are created in other, very specific ways.

A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows you to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghasts, ghouls, shadow, wights, and wraiths. The following types of undead can be created by casters of the specified levels:
 &lt;pre&gt;Cleric Level 	Undead Created ------------ 	--------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;11 or lower 	Ghoul 12-13 		Shadow 14-15 		Ghast 16-19 		Wight 20 		Wraith&lt;/pre&gt; 
You may create less powerful undead than your level would indicate if you choose. For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or shadow instead of a wight. Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. You may attempt to command the undead as it forms.
 
This spell must be cast at night.

  <Description>
This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large (possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles).
 
Note: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

  <Description>
When you utter the spell of creeping doom, you call forth a mass of 1,000 venomous, biting and stinging spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes. This carpetlike mass swarms in a square 20 feet on a side. Upon your command, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round toward any prey within 100 feet, moving in the direction you command. Each vermin in the creeping doom effect automatically bites a creature for 1 point of damage and then dies. Each creature takes enough damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Thus, a total of 1,000 points of damage can be inflicted on those in the creeping doom's effect. These attacks are nonmagical attacks, so creatures with damage reduction, for example, are safe.
 
If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, damage is distributed among the survivors equally.
 
If creeping doom travels more than 100 feet away from you, it loses 50 of its number for each additional 10 feet it travels. For example, at 120 feet, its numbers have shrunk by 100. There are a number of ways to thwart or destroy the creatures forming the swarm. Anything that would deter or destroy normal insects is effective against these insects.

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +5).
 
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius. Not even creatures who can normally see in the dark (such as with darkvision) can see in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) do not work, nor do light spells of lower level (flare, light, dancing lights). Darkness and the 2nd-level spell daylight cancel each other, leaving whatever light conditions normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells. Higher-level light spells (such as the 3rd-level cleric spell daylight) are not affected by darkness.
 
If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
 
Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.

If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and +2 Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells.) These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the target creature.

As fireball, except this spell is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame detonates with a low roar and delivers 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level.
 
The glowing bead created by the spell can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for up to 5 rounds. You choose the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and the delay cannot change once it has been set (unless someone touches the bead; see below). If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while the creature is handling it.

This spell imbues an area with negative energy. All Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area suffer a -3 profane penalty. Undead entering this area gain a +1 profane bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Undead created within or summoned into a desecrated area gain +1 hit points per HD.
 
If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the effects are doubled (turning at -6, +2 profane bonuses to undead rolls, +2 hit points per HD).
 
If the area contains a similar fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the desecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses to undead as listed above.
 
Desecrate counters and dispels consecrate.

  <Description>
You can detect a particular type of animal or plant in a quarter circle emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a species of animal or plant when using the spell. Each round you can change the animal or plant type. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific type of animal or plant:
 
1st Round: Presence or absence of the animal or plant type in that quarter.
 
2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified type in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen.
 
3rd Round: The condition and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
 
Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:
 
Normal: Has at least 90% of original hit points, free of disease.
 
Fair: 30% to 90% of original hit points remaining.
 
Poor: Up to 30% of original hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.
 
Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled.
 
If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two.
 
Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
 
The DM decides if a specific type of animal or plant is present.

You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:
 
1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.
 
2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the strength of the strongest evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest evil aura's strength is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack you.
 
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
 
Aura Strength: An aura's evil power and strength depend on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level.
 &lt;pre&gt;Creature/Object	Evil Power ---------------	----------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Evil creature 	HD / 5 Undead creature HD / 2 Evil elemental 	HD / 2 Evil magic item  or spell 	Caster level / 2 Evil outsider 	HD Cleric of an  evil deity 	Level&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Evil Power	Aura Strength ----------	-------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Lingering 	Dim 1 or less 	Faint 2-4 			Moderate 5-10 		Strong 11+ 		Overwhelming&lt;/pre&gt; 
If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.
 
Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:
 &lt;pre&gt;Original Strength	Duration -----------------	--------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Faint 			1d6 minutes Moderate 		1d6 X 10 minutes Strong 			1d6 hours Overwhelming 		1d6 days&lt;/pre&gt; 
Remember that animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil; this spell does not detect them.
 
Note: Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:
 
1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
 
2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the strength of the strongest aura.
 
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) 
 
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.
 
Aura Strength: An aura's magical power and strength depend on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level.
 &lt;pre&gt;		Functioning	Item 		Spell 		Caster Strength 	Level 		Level -------- 	-----------	------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Dim 		0-level or 	Lingering 		lingering aura	aura Faint 		1st-3rd		1st-5th Moderate 	4th-6th 	6th-11th Strong 		7th-9th 	12th-20th Overwhelming 	Artifact or 	Beyond 		deity-level 	mortal 		magic 		caster&lt;/pre&gt; 
If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.
 
Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:
 &lt;pre&gt;Aura Strength	Duration -------------	--------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Faint 		1d6 minutes Moderate 	1d6 X 10 minutes Strong 		1d6 hours Overwhelming 	1d6 days&lt;/pre&gt; 
Note: Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are conjured, the conjuration spell registers.

You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of clairaudience/clairvoyance or scrying. The spell's effect radiates from you moves as you move. The spell also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magic scrying devices. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.
 
If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location. If the attempt originates outside this range, you and the scrier immediately make opposed Scry skill checks. (A Scry check is the same as an Intelligence check for a creature without the Scry skill.) If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and a sense of the scrier's direction and distance from you (accurate to within one-tenth the distance).

1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors.
 
2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile traps, hunting snares, etc.). The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.
 
The spell does detect certain natural hazards---quicksand (registers as a snare), a sinkhole (pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell snare), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.
 
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area:
 
1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards.
 
2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
 
Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.
 
Note: Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

2nd Round: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest undead aura's strength is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack you.
 
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
 
Aura Strength: The strength of the undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature.
 &lt;pre&gt;Strength 	HD -------- 	-- Dim 		Lingering aura Faint 		1 or less Moderate 	2-4 Strong 		5-10 Overwhelming 	11+&lt;/pre&gt; 
Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:

Uttering dictum creates two effects.
 
If you are on your home plane, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the dictum.
 
Creatures native to your plane who hear the dictum and are not lawful suffer the following ill effects:
 &lt;pre&gt;HD 		Effect -- 		------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;12 or more 	Deafened Less than 12 	Slowed, deafened Less than 8 	Paralyzed, slowed, deafened Less than 4 	Killed, paralyzed, slowed, deafened&lt;/pre&gt; 
The effects are cumulative.
 
Deafened: The creature is struck deaf (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4 rounds.
 
Slowed: The creature is slowed, as by the slow spell, for 2d4 rounds.
 
Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.
 
Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired---whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction, such as "900 feet straight downward," or "upward to the northwest, 45-degree angle, 1,200 feet." After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.
 
If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you become trapped in the Astral Plane. Each round that you are trapped in the Astral Plane in this way, you may make a Will save (DC 25) to return to the Material Plane at a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, make a Will save (DC 25) each minute to appear in a free space within 1,000 feet. If there's no free space within 1,000 feet, you are stuck on the Astral Plane until rescued.

A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks bodily extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by the dimensional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. It prevents the use of a gate or teleportation circle for the duration of the spell.
 
The dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms such as a basilisk's gaze. Also, it does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

This spell has two versions:
 
Prune Growth: The first version causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, and so forth) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about a third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed.
 
At your option, the area can be a circle with a radius of 100 feet, a semicircle with a radius of 150 feet, or a quarter circle with a radius of 200 feet. You may also designate areas within the area that are not affected.
 
Stunt: The second version targets normal plants within a range of one-half mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to one-third below normal.
 
Diminish plants counters plant growth.

  <Description>
Each round, you concentrate on one subject, who must be in range. You know if the subject deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in her aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, you may concentrate on a different subject.

  <Description>
A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and plane where the subject lies.
 
To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched the object at least once.

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger, causing the creature or object it strikes to glow and vanish, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter is affected, so the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even magical matter or energy of a magical nature, such as Bigby's forceful hand or a wall of force, but not a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is only partially affected. It takes 5d6 points of damage instead of disintegrating. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected (that is, the ray affects only one target per casting).

This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane. Add the creature's HD to its saving throw and subtract your level as well. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.

Shimmering, white, holy energy surrounds you. This power has three effects:
 
1. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures.
 
2. On making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature negates the effects with a Will save (SR applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.
 
3. With a touch, you can automatically dispel any one enchantment cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Exception: Spells that can't be dispelled by dispel magic also can't be dispelled by dispel evil. Saving throws and SR do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.

  <Description>
You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells. Dispel magic affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells.
 
Note: The effects of spells with instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magic effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.
 
You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
 
Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the spell. You make a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level.
 
If the spellcaster targets an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), she makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
 
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. Remember that a magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
 
You automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
 
Area Dispel: The spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius.
 
For each creature who is the target of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel so far as that target is concerned) or fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.
 
For each object that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by area dispels.
 
For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the dispel magic's area, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
 
For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel, you make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the area of the dispel magic.
 
If an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell, such as a monster summoned by monster summoning, is in the area, you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
 
You may choose to automatically succeed at dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
 
Counterspell: The spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work. You must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

  <Description>
Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
 
In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. Note that if your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful.
 
The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
 
As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination and yield the same answer each time.
 &lt;material-components&gt;Worth at least 25 gp.&lt;/material-components&gt;</Description>

You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such as "Attack," "Run," and "Fetch." Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.
 
Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the subject animal. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the animal to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the animal, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the animal unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do.

You can control the actions of any humanoid that is Medium-size or smaller. You establish a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of his abilities. If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from him.
 
Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their nature receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
 
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or dispel it.

You call some nonliving item from virtually any location directly to your hand.
 
First, you place your arcane mark on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a gem worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.
 
If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast.
 
The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to anyone but you.
 
The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.

  <Description>
You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. 
 
The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to her body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.
 
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. She can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. If the messenger is disturbed during the trance, she awakens, and the spell ends.
 
Creatures who don't sleep or dream (such as elves, but not half-elves) cannot be contacted by this spell.
 
The messenger is unaware of her own surroundings or the activities around her while in the trance. She is defenseless, both physically and mentally (she always fails any saving throw, for example) while in the trance.

  <Description>
When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. It knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The shock lasts 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. Spellcasters on the ground must make Concentration checks (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spells they try to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The exact effects depend on the terrain and its features:
 
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex half DC 15). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
 
Cliffs: They crumble, causing a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path sustains 8d6 points of damage (Reflex half DC 15).
 
Open Ground: All creatures standing in the area must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or fall down. Fissures open in the ground, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex save DC 20 to avoid the fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
 
Structure: Most structures standing on open ground collapse, dealing 8d6 points of damage to those caught within or beneath the rubble (Reflex half DC 15).
 
River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Creatures must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane. A druid can choose which plane (air, earth, fire, or water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain. You can then summon elementals from that plane.
 
When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has at least 5 hit points per HD (that is, at least 60, 80, or 100 hit points, respectively). Once the elementals appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
 
The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
 
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, elemental swarm is a fire spell when you cast it to summon fire elementals and a water spell when you use it to summon water elementals.

This spell arouses a single emotion of your choice in the subjects. You can choose any one of the following versions:
 
Despair: The enchanted creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty to saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Emotion (despair) dispels emotion (hope).
 
Fear: The enchanted creatures flee from you whenever they are in sight of you. Emotion (fear) dispels emotion (rage).
 
Friendship: The enchanted creatures react more positively toward others. Their attitude shifts to the next more favorable reaction (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to indifferent, indifferent to friendly, or friendly to helpful). Creatures involved in combat, however, continue to fight back normally. Emotion (friendship) dispels emotion (hate).
 
Hate: The enchanted creatures react more negatively toward others. Their attitude shifts to the next less favorable reaction (helpful to friendly, friendly to indifferent, indifferent to unfriendly, or unfriendly to hostile). Emotion (hate) dispels emotion (friendship).
 
Hope: The enchanted creatures gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Emotion (hope) dispels emotion (despair).
 
Rage: The enchanted creatures gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -1 penalty to AC. They are compelled to fight heedless of danger. Emotion (rage) does not stack with barbarian rage or with itself. Emotion (rage) dispels emotion (fear).

  <Description>
This abjuration grants a creature limited protection to damage from whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
 
Endure elements absorbs only damage. The character could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.
 
Note: Endure elements overlaps (and does not stack with) resist elements and protection from elements. If a character is warded by protection from elements and one or both of the other spells, the protection spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted. If a character is warded by resist elements and endure elements at the same time, the resist spell absorbs damage but the endure spell does not.

  <Description>
This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. The subject grows by up to 10% per caster level, increasing by this amount in height, width, and depth (to a maximum of 50%). Weight increases by approximately the cube of the size increase, as follows:
 &lt;pre&gt;Height Increase	Weight Increase --------------- ---------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;+10% (x 1.1)	+30% (x 1.3) +20% (x 1.2)	+70% (x 1.7) +30% (x 1.3)	+120%(x 2.2) +40% (x 1.4)	+170% (x 2.7) +50% (x 1.5)	+240% (x 3.4)&lt;/pre&gt; 
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process. However, it is constrained without harm by stronger materials---the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.
 
Magical properties are not increased by this spell. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and base attack bonus do not change, but Strength increases along with size. For every 20% of enlargement, the creature gains a +1 enlargement bonus to Strength.
 
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
 
Enlarge counters and dispels reduce.

Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area or those who enter the area, holding them fast. An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell. She can break free and move half her normal speed by using a full-round action to make a Strength check or an Escape Artist check (DC 20). A creature who succeeds at a Reflex saving throw is not entangled but can still move at only half speed through the area. Each round, the plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures who have avoided or escaped entanglement.

If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Those of a race or religion unfriendly to yours have a +4 bonus to the saving throw. 
 
Creatures with 4 or more HD or with Wisdom scores of 16 or higher remain aware of their surroundings and have an attitude of indifferent. They gain new saving throws if they witness actions that they oppose.
 
The enchantment lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or perform any action other than speaking or singing.
 
If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell. This check is based on the character with the highest Charisma and has a +2 bonus for each other jeerer who can make a Charisma check of 10 or higher. The heckling ends the spell if it beats your opposed Charisma check. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.
 
If any member of the audience is attacked (or subjected to an overtly hostile act), the spell ends and the audience becomes immediately unfriendly toward you (or hostile, for audience members with 4 or more HD and Wisdom 16 or higher).

Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from up to two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. It removes explosive runes, glyphs of warding, sepia snake sigils, and arcane marks, but it does not remove illusory script or symbols. Nonmagical writings are automatically erased if you touch them and no one else is holding them. Otherwise, the chance is 90%. Magic writings must be touched, and you must roll 15+ on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) to succeed. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a miss on this roll.) If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate the runes, glyph, or sigil instead.

This spell conjures many rubbery black tentacles. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot---including water. There are 1d4 such tentacles, plus one per caster level, appearing randomly scattered about the area. Each tentacle is 10 feet long (Large) and saves as you do. It has AC 16, 1 hit point/per caster level, an attack bonus of +1/per caster level, and a Strength score of 19 (+4 bonus). It is immune to spells that don't cause damage (other than disintegrate).
 
Each round that a tentacle is not already grappling someone or something, starting the round after it appears, it makes a grapple attack at a random creature or object within 10 feet of it. These attacks take place on your turn. The tentacles do not attack each other, nor do they attack objects that are smaller than a Medium-size creature. The attacks are like regular grappling attacks, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity from opponents. Also, they cause 1d6 points of normal damage (+4 for Strength), not subdual damage. A tentacle maintains its grapple even after its subject is dying or dead.

You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of damage. Anyone next to the runes (close enough to read them) takes this damage with no saving throw. Others within 10 feet of the runes take half damage if they succeed at Reflex saving throws. The object in which the runes were written also takes the damage (no saving throw).
 
As the spellcaster, you and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Others can remove them with a successful dispel magic or erase spell. However, attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

You can merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to affect it with one of four magical effects: charm, fear, sicken, or sleep. You select one of these four possible gaze attacks when casting the spell. You retain the gaze power for 1 round for every three caster levels and can use the gaze attack as a free action each round.
 
These effects do not affect undead creatures or extend beyond the plane you currently occupy. You are subject to the effects of your reflected gaze and are allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, you are held (as a hold monster spell).
 
The four versions of the spell are as follows:
 
Charm: Equivalent to the charm monster spell, except that the saving throw is based on spell level 6.
 
Fear: The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. Once it stops fleeing, the creature refuses to face you for 10 minutes per your caster level. If subsequently confronted by you, it either cowers or bolts for the nearest cover (50% chance of either). This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind-affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save (SR applies).
 
Sicken: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. An affected creature's speed is reduced by half, it loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and it suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls. The creature remains stricken for 10 minutes per your caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. This is a necromancy effect; it can be negated by a Fortitude save (SR applies).
 
Sleep: The subject falls asleep. The creature sleeps for your caster level x 10 minutes but can be slapped awake. This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind-affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save (SR applies).
 
Note: Each round, a gaze attack automatically works against one creature within range that is looking at (attacking or interacting with) the gazing creature.

You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.
 
You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, etc.).
 
Casting requires 1 full round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally caused by darkness, blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your word at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

You and all you desire within the area of the spell become undetectable to scrying (whether by spell or magic device). Furthermore, if you are aware of an attempt to scry, you can create whatever image you desire, including sight and sound, according to the medium of the scrying method. To do this, you must concentrate on the figment you are creating. Once concentration is broken, no further images can be created, although the area remains undetectable for the duration of the spell.

An invisible cone of terror causes living creatures to become panicked. They suffer a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from you. A panicked creature has a 50% chance to drop what it's holding, chooses its path randomly (as long as it is getting away from immediate danger), and flees any other dangers that confront it. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers.

  <Description>
The creatures or objects affected fall slowly (though faster than feathers typically do). The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 60 feet a round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), with no damage incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall resumes.
 
The character can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save herself if she unexpectedly falls. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
 
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the item does half normal damage based on weight with no bonus for the height of the drop.
 
The spell works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

Creatures who can cast arcane spells or use arcane spell-like effects suffer a -4 penalty on their saving throws.

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination. Note that the spell works with respect to locales, not objects or creatures within a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
 
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead him to his destination, indicating at the appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. The spell frees the subject, and those with him, from a maze spell in a single round.
 
This divination is keyed to the recipient, not his companions, and does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).

Acorn Grenades: Up to four acorns turn into special grenadelike weapons that can be hurled up to 100 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d8), divided up among the acorns as you wish. A 20th-level druid could create one 20d8 missile, two 10d8 missiles, one 11d8 and three 3d8 missiles, or any other combination of d8s totaling up to four acorns and 20d8 points of damage. The acorns deal 1 point of splash damage per die and ignite any combustible materials within 10 feet. If a creature within the burst area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage; a creature struck directly always sustains full damage (no saving throw).
 
Holly Berry Bombs: You turn up to eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, being too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). They burst into flame if you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to creatures and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. Creatures who successfully make Reflex saving throws take half damage.

  <Description>
This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature who attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
 
Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as two-handed spears, do not endanger their users in this way.
 
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat and giving light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)---blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.
 
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
 
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap wards. The fire trap can ward any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth). When casting fire trap, you select a point on the item as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the item, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
 
The fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
 
A knock spell does not affect a fire trap in any way, because knock only opens things and the fire trap in no way prevents one from opening the trapped item. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
 
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
 
As the caster, you can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. "Attuning" usually involves a password that you can share with friends.

A fireball spell is a burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
 
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
 
The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

You can either create flames that turn normal arrows, bolts, and stones into fiery projectiles, or you can create fiery bolts and shoot them at enemies.
 
Flaming Normal Projectiles: When choosing this version, you can affect up to one projectile per level. The projectiles must all be within 10 feet of you at the time of casting. If shot before the end of the next round, these projectiles catch fire. If they hit, they deal additional fire damage equal to half your caster level (up to +10). The flaming projectiles can easily ignite flammable materials or structures. No saving throw is allowed for this version of the spell.
 
Fiery Bolts: When creating a fiery bolt, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack roll to hit. The bolt deals 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex save half). If you create extra bolts (at 8th level or higher), all bolts must be aimed at enemies that are all within 30 feet of each other.

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage, which is all fire damage. The flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth. It can harm any creature who is harmed by magical fire.
 
The spell does not function underwater.

A flame strike produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the rest results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from elements (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic.

  <Description>
A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round and can leap up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature. (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.) The flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls. The sphere ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch.
 
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move-equivalent action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

This cantrip creates a burst of bright light. If you cause the light to burst directly in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled. A dazzled creature suffers a -1 penalty on attack rolls. The creature recovers in 1 minute. Sightless creatures are not affected by flare.

The subject and all possessions it carries turn into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the being (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead (its soul doesn't pass on), but it does not seem to be alive either (when viewed with spells such as deathwatch). Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

  <Description>
The spell's subject can fly with a speed of 90 feet (60 feet if the creature wears medium or heavy armor). The subject can fly up at half speed and descend at double speed. The flying subject's maneuverability rating is good. Using the fly spell requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load (see page 142), plus any armor it wears.
 
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject drops 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also falls in this way if the fly spell is dispelled.

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
 
A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
 
The spell does not function underwater.

  <Description>
Forbiddance prevents creatures whose alignments are different from yours from entering the area. Additionally, the spell seals the area against all planar travel into it, including dimension door, teleport, plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. At your option, the abjuration can be locked by a password, in which case it can be entered only by those speaking the proper words (no saving throw allowed to those who don't speak the password, although SR applies). Otherwise, the effect on those entering the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours.
 
Alignments identical: No effect. The creature may enter freely (albeit not by planar travel).
 
Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil: The creature is hedged out and takes 3d6 points of damage. A successful Will save negates both effects, and SR applies.
 
Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil: The creature is hedged out and takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful Will save negates both effects, and SR applies.
 
Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder cannot enter the forbidden area (future saving throws likewise fail). Intruders who enter by rolling successful saving throws feel uneasy and tense, despite their success.
 
Dispel magic does not dispel the forbiddance effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level.

This powerful spell brings into being an immobile cubical prison with bars or solid walls of force (your choice).
 
Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside or can pass through the slits in the barred cage. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
 
Like a wall of force spell, the forcecage resists dispel magic, but it is vulnerable to a disintegrate spell, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation.
 
Barred Cage: The barred cage is a 20-foot cube with bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between the bars.
 
Windowless Cell: The cell is a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

  <Description>
This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once the spell is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself---duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on---and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and to Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
 
When another creature is the object of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and it can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the spell subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

This spell enables you or the creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement.
 
The spell also allows a character to move and attack normally while underwater, even with cutting weapons and with bludgeoning weapons provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The freedom of movement spell does not, however, allow water breathing.

The subject and all her gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. The subject gains damage reduction 20/+1. Her material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though her size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force armor (for example, from the mage armor spell) still apply. She becomes immune to poison and critical hits. She can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (Note that this does not rule out certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the metamagic feats Silent Spell and Still Spell.) As with polymorph other, the subject loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If she has a touch spell ready to use, it is discharged harmlessly when the spell takes effect.
 
The gaseous creature can't run but she can fly (speed 10, maneuverability perfect). She can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all she was wearing or holding in her hands, as long as the spell persists. She is subject to wind. She can't enter water or other liquid.

  <Description>
Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and the plane desired, allowing travel between the planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or type of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window into the plane you named, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. The gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to another plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
 
Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, gate functions much like the plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Note that deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you---anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
 
You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level) and must concentrate on doing so or sever the interplanar connection.
 
Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or type of being as you cast the spell, you may cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures.
 
If you choose to call a type of being instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. If several creatures, you can call and control them as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more than twice your caster level in HD can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
 
A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. These fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
 
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from the called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward. In general, a gift of 100 gp per HD of the called creature per day of service is reasonable. (Unfortunately, some creatures want their payment in "livestock" rather than in coin, which may involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
 
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
 
Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon.

As lesser geas, except that geas/quest affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.
 
Instead of suffering penalties to abilities, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day he does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day he must make a Fortitude saving throw or sicken. A sickened creature moves at half his normal speed and suffers -4 penalties on both Strength and Dexterity. He heals damage at one-tenth his normal rate and cannot benefit from any magical healing effects. A sickened creature must make a Fortitude save each day or become crippled. Once crippled, the subject is effectively disabled (as if he had 0 hit points) and can't choose to take strenuous actions. These effects end 1 day after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest.
 
Remove curse ends the geas/quest only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end the geas/quest, although limited wish, miracle, and wish do.
 
Wizard and bards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.

Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the spell creates when casting the spell and cannot thereafter change its basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire cat is equal to the noise from twenty humans.
 
Note that ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.

You turn one or more normal-sized insects, arachnids, or other vermin into larger forms resembling giant vermin. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly), and all must be grown to the same number of HD. The number of vermin and the HD to which they can be grown depends upon your level; see the accompanying table.
 &lt;pre&gt;Caster	Target's	New	Armor	Attack/			-------------- Saves ---------------- Level	New HD		Size	Class	Damage		Fortitude	Reflex		Will ------	-------- 	----	-----	-------		---------	------		----&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;7-9 	3d8+6 		Large 	14 	+4/1d8+4	+5 		+0 		+1 10-12 	4d8+16 		Huge 	14 	+8/2d6+8 	+8 		+0 		+1 13-15 	5d8+20 		Huge 	14 	+8/2d6+8 	+8 		+0 		+1 16-18 	6d8+24 		Huge 	14 	+9/2d6+8 	+9 		+1 		+2 19-20 	7d8+28 		Huge 	14 	+9/2d6+8 	+9 		+1 		+2&lt;/pre&gt; 
Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands ("Attack," "Defend," "Stop," and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

A cloud of glittering golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, blinding creatures and visibly outlining invisible things. Blindness lasts for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.
 
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to opponents' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.

  <Description>
This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.
 
You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature violating the warded area without speaking a pass phrase (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or species (such as "drow" or "aberration"). Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.
 
When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.
 
Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection can fool a glyph.
 
Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 13). Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).
 
Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
 
Blast Glyph: A blast deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of the intruder (maximum 5d8). This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Those affected can make Reflex saves to take half damage.
 
Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of up to 3rd level that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. All saving throws operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the glyph.

  <Description>
A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or slip, skid, and fall. Those that successfully save can move at half speed across the surface. However, those that remain in the area must each make a new saving throw every round to avoid falling and to be able to move. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not).
 
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item---a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.

This spell gives a weapon an enhancement bonus to attack and damage of +1 per three caster levels (maximum +5). An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attacks.
 
Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must all be of the same type, and they have to be together in one group (such as in the same quiver). Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their transmutation when used.
 
If you're a good cleric, the cleric of a good deity, or a paladin, the weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures.

Greater restoration also dispels all magical effects penalizing the character's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects. Greater restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

As shadow evocation, but it enables the caster to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocations of up to 5th level. If recognized as greater shadow evocation, damaging spells deal only two-fifths (40%) of normal damage, with a minimum of 2 points per die of damage. For example, a greater shadow cloudkill has a 40% chance to kill creatures of 6 HD or less, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD get a saving throw. Creatures not killed take 1d10 x 0.4 points of damage each round.
 
Nondamaging effects, such as a web's ensnarement, are only 40% likely to work when the greater shadow evocation is recognized as mostly illusory (roll separately for each effect and each creature who recognizes the evocation as shadowy).

  <Description>
This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be up to 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area:
 
Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have full concealment (50% miss chance; the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Spell resistance: No.
 
Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Spell resistance: No.
 
Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Spell resistance: Yes.
 
Confusion: Where there are choices in direction---such as a corridor intersection or side passage---a minor confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the exact opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment (mind-affecting) effect. Spell resistance: No.
 
Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a glamer to appear as if it were a plain wall. Spell resistance: No.
 
In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a         simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long         as the guards and wards spell lasts. Spell resistance:         No.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* A magic mouth in two places. Spell resistance: No.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in         the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes         if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell         lasts. Spell resistance: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Spell         resistance: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* A suggestion in one place. You select an area up to 5         feet square, and any creature who enters or passes         through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Spell         resistance: Yes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards effect.

This spell creates a strong blast of air that originates from you and moves in the direction you are facing. The force of this gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish these lights. Creatures caught in the area may be affected. Any creature is entitled to a saving throw to ignore the gust's effects.
 
A gust of wind can do anything a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of the range.

Hallow makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.
 
First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against evil effect.
 
Second, all Charisma checks to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus and Charisma checks to command undead suffer a -4 sacred penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (Note: This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)
 
Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature.
 
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the hallow site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire consecrated site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallow again.
 
Spell effects that may be tied to a hallow site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, negative energy protection, protection from elements, remove fear, resist elements, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
 
An area can receive only one hallow (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
 
Hallow counters or dispels unhallow.

  <Description>
You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

  <Description>
This spell renders up to three undead creatures immobile. Nonintelligent undead (such as skeletons and zombies) get no saving throw; intelligent undead do. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature). The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.

The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

He can jump one and a half times as far as normal. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus.

Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away disease and injury. It completely cures all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage, and all temporary ability damage. It neutralizes poisons in the subject's system. so that no additional damage or effects are suffered. It offsets a feeblemind spell. It cures those mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain. Only a single application of the spell is needed to simultaneously achieve all these effects.
 
Heal does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained ability scores.
 
If used against an undead creature, heal acts like harm.

Enchanted metal gets a saving throw to resist. Just as damage from chill metal negates fire damage, so damage from heat metal negates cold damage on a one-for-one basis. If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.
 
Heat metal counters and dispels chill metal.

  <Description>
You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find someone within five miles. The hand then beckons to that person and leads her to you if she follows it.
 
When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.
 &lt;pre&gt;Distance	Time to Locate --------	--------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Up to 100 ft.	1 round 1,000 ft.	1 minute One mile	10 minutes Two miles	1 hour Three miles	2 hours Four miles	3 hours Five miles	4 hours&lt;/pre&gt; 
Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons her to follow it. If she follows, the hand points in your direction, leading her in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before her at a rate of anywhere up to 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject to you, it disappears.
 
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If she chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; she will have to rely on her own devices to locate you.
 
If more than one subject within a five-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.
 
If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within five miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.
 
The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and potential subjects. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading her back to you. The hand does not pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than five miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and blinding evil creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects:
 
First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus to saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.
 
Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.
 
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does.
 
Finally, if an evil creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against holy aura's save DC).

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.
 
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to evil creatures and blinds them for 1 round. A successful Reflex saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinding effect.
 
The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. They can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Reflex save.
 
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to opponents' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.

This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals double damage against evil opponents. It emits a magic circle against evil (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand for any reason. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time.
 
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with bless weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.
 
This spell does not work on artifacts.
 
Note: A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

Uttering holy word has two effects.
 
If you are on your home plane, the spell instantly banishes nongood extraplanar creatures within the area back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the holy word.
 
Creatures native to your plane who hear the holy word and are not good suffer the following ill effects:
 &lt;pre&gt;HD		Effect --		------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;12 or more	Deafened Less than 12	Blinded, deafened Less than 8	Paralyzed, blinded, deafened Less than 4	Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened&lt;/pre&gt; 
The effects are cumulative.
 
Deafened: The creature is deafened (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4 rounds.
 
Blinded: The creature is blinded (see blindness/deafness) for 2d4 rounds.
 
Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.
 
Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 +1 per caster level to determine the total number of HD affected (maximum +10). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures gaze at the lights, heedless of all else, acting as if they are affected by hypnotism. However, you cannot make suggestions as with hypnotism. Sightless creatures are not affected.

  <Description>
Your gestures and droning incantation cause creatures nearby to stop and stare blankly at you, hypnotized. You can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures who can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be hypnotized.
 
If you use this spell in combat, the targets gain a +2 bonus to their saving throws. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2. While hypnotized, a creature's Spot and Listen checks suffer a -4 penalty. Any potential threat (such as an armed party member moving behind the hypnotized creature) allows the creature a second saving throw. Any obvious threat, such as casting a spell, drawing a sword, or aiming an arrow, automatically breaks the hypnotism, as does shaking or slapping the creature. A hypnotized creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.
 
While the subject is hypnotized, you can make a suggestion or request (provided you can communicate with it). The suggestion must be brief and reasonable. An affected creature reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. Even once the spell ends, it retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular suggestion.
 
A creature who fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.

  <Description>
The spell determines the single most basic function of each magic item, including how to activate that function (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any). For example, a +2 vorpal sword, a +2 dancing sword, and a +2 sword would all register as "+2 to attack and damage rolls."
 
If a magic item has multiple different functions that are equally basic, identify determines the lowest-level function. If these functions are also of equal level, the DM decides randomly which is identified.

  <Description>
You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of foreign or magic writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's completely unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script.
 
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of the book," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
 
The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or probing searches reveal the true nature of the surface, though they do not cause the illusion to disappear.

  <Description>
You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this bestowal. Only cleric abjurations, divinations, or conjuration (healing) spells can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on her HD; even multiple castings of imbue with spell ability can't exceed this limit. If your limit of 4th-level spells decreases, and it drops below the current number of active imbue with spell ability spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.
 &lt;pre&gt;HD of 		Spells Recipient 	Imbued --------- 	------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;1-2 		One 1st-level spell 3-4 		Up to two 1st-level spells 5+ 		Up to two 1st- and one 2nd-level spell&lt;/pre&gt; 
The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, etc.) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient.
 
Once you cast imbue with spell ability on another character, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the transferred spells or is slain. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put.
 
To cast a spell with a verbal component, the recipient must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, she must have humanlike hands. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, she must have the materials or focus.

When you cast imprisonment and touch an opponent, he is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the temporal stasis spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does. A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient but will reveal where it is entombed. The imprisonment spell functions only if the target's name and some facts about its life are known.

  <Description>
An incendiary cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire damage to everything within it each round (half damage on a successful Reflex save).
 
As with a cloudkill spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move up to 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter.
 
As with fog cloud, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.

A horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects swarm in a thick cloud when you cast this spell. The insects limit vision to 10 feet, and spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures inside the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage at the end of each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer HD are driven from the cloud at their fastest possible speed in a random direction and flee until they are at least 100 feet away from the insects. Creatures with 3 to 5 HD flee as well, though a Will save negates this effect. (This urge to flee is an extraordinary fear effect.)
 
Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for 1 round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, and ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind (21+ mph) that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell.

The creature or object touched vanishes from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.
 
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
 
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an "attack" includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Note that spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility sphere ends.

You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.
 
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you suffer a -6 Dexterity penalty as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a -8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.
 
Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 points of lethal damage, and you are considered "armed" when making unarmed attacks (a Small caster deals 1d4 points of damage, not 1d6).
 
Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean---at least until the spell expires.

Ironwood is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron (such as heat metal) do not function on ironwood. Spells that affect wood (such as wood shape) do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn. Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal, steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.
 
Further, if you make only half as much ironwood as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so transmuted is treated as a +1 magic item.

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A normal threat range becomes 19-20. A threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20. A threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons (and it does not stack with itself). If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.

The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or becomes stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area. A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells.

You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but note that you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 x 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore next time). If you know only rumors, casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore).
 
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters 11th level and higher are "legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for up to 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
 
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time---even wishes do not allow exceptions. The chests themselves are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
 
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it. 
 
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally; and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.

You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast---stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
 
The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise---it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants).
 
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
 
The secure shelter contains rude furnishings---eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half of the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. Up to nine other Medium-size creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
 
The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it's -20° outside, inside it'll be 50°). The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
 
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, screw-on cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.
 
If another Leomund's trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.

A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell.
 
If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for a whole day, he suffers a -2 penalty on each ability score. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. Abilities are not reduced below 1. The ability penalties end 1 day after the character resumes obeying the lesser geas.
 
A lesser geas (and all ability penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.

By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of up to 8 HD) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).
 
You may ask the creature to perform one task for you, and the creature may request some service in return. The more demanding your request, the greater return favor the creature asks for. This bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. If you agree to the service, the creature performs the task you requested, reports back to you afterward (if possible), and returns to its home plane. You are honor bound to perform the return favor.
 
A creature may accept some form of payment, such as a magic item, in return for its service. The creature may keep it or may deliver the item to another member of your religion somewhere else, where it can help the religion's cause.
 
Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser planar ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental.

  <Description>
Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
 
To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The type of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the spell.
 
The target creature must attempt a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep the creature from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with a successful SR roll, dimensional travel, or a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 its level + its Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram to make the trap more secure.
 
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The DM then assigns a bonus based on the service and reward, from 0 to +6. This bonus applies to your Charisma check. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
 
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
 
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.

Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move-equivalent action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base speed).
 
A levitating creature who attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.

  <Description>
You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.
 
The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. A limited wish can do any of the following:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or         lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited         to you.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower,         provided the spell is not from a school prohibited to         you.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any wizard/sorcerer spell of 5th level or         lower even if it's from a prohibited school.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower even if         it's from a prohibited school.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as         geas/quest or insanity.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Have any other effect whose power level is in line with         the above effects, such as a single creature         automatically hitting on its next attack or suffering a         -7 penalty on its next saving throw.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a limited wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.

This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while liveoak is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.
 
Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. For instance, "Attack any persons who come near without first saying 'sacred mistletoe'" is an eleven-word trigger phrase that you could use at 11th level or higher. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. Statistics for a treant can be found in the Monster Manual. (At the DM's option, you can extrapolate stats for a smaller tree from the treant statistics if you cast liveoak on a smaller oak.)
 
If liveoak is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, it tries to return to its original location before taking root.

As locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature.
 
You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided the creature is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.
 
The spell can locate a creature of a specific type (such as human or unicorn) or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a general type (such as humanoid or beast). To find a type of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.
 
Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, and even a ladder. You can search for general items such as a stairway, a sword, or a jewel, in which case you locate the nearest one of its type if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a specific item, such as a particular piece of jewelry, requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique object (such as "Baron Vulden's signet ring") unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).
 
The spell is blocked by lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object fools it.

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of mage armor, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

  <Description>
As protection from evil, except that it encompasses a much larger area and its duration is longer.
 
Unlike protection from evil, this spell has a special function that you may choose when casting the spell. A magic circle can be focused inward rather than outward. In this case, it serves as an immobile, temporary magical prison for a summoned creature. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. 
 
You must beat a creature's SR in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' SR.
 
If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.
 
This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.

If you're a good druid, the natural weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures.

  <Description>
By casting magic jar, you place your own soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the magic jar), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body (leaving the receptacle empty).
 
To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
 
While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (on the same plane). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You, however, cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of four or more HD and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)
 
Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds at a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds at further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
 
If successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep most mental abilities and gain some physical abilities, as with polymorph other (except that you get the creature's actual physical abilities, not average ones).
 
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
 
If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (that is, it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
 
If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host.
 
Incorporeal creatures with the magic jar ability can use a handy, nearby object (not just a gem or crystal) as the magic jar.

  <Description>
This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated. For instance, if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object or creature.
 
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Note that actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, HD, or class except by external garb.
 
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers up to 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

You transmute up to three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls. The creature using the stones makes a normal ranged attack to use a magic stone. Each magic stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the enhancement bonus). Against undead creatures, this damage is doubled (2d6+2 points).

Note: An enhancement bonus increases armor's or a shield's benefit to the wearer's AC. A suit of armor cannot have more than +5 in total bonuses (even if some of its bonus is from other than enhancement).

  <Description>
As minor creation, except you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, etc. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity:
 &lt;pre&gt;Hardness and Rarity Examples				Duration ---------------				--------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Vegetable matter 			2 hours/level Stone, crystal, base metals		1 hour/level Precious metals 			20 minutes/level Gems 					10 minutes/level Mithral* 				2 rounds/level Adamantite** 				1 round/level&lt;/pre&gt; 
*Includes similar rare metals. Items made of mithral are 50% lighter than similar items made of steel. **Items made of adamantite weigh 75% as much as similar items made of steel. They are also harder and better capable of retaining an edge, so armor and shields provide 1 higher AC and weapons allow +1 on attack and damage rolls (although the items are not magical).

  <Description>
When moral suasion fails to win a criminal over to right conduct, you can use mark of justice to encourage the criminal to walk the straight and narrow path.
 
You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse.
 
Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast only it on someone who is willing or restrained.
 
Like bestow curse, mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse, however, works only if the caster is at least as high level as your mark of justice. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.

(If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 80 feet.)

  <Description>
You conjure up an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes, and the subject vanishes into it. If the subject attempts to escape, the time it takes to find the way out depends on its Intelligence score:
 &lt;pre&gt;Intelligence Score	Time Trapped of Mazed Creature	in Maze ------------------	------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Under 3 		2d4 minutes 3 			1d6 minutes 4-5 			1d4 minutes 6-8 			5d4 rounds 9-12 			4d4 rounds 13-15 			3d4 rounds 16-17 			2d4 rounds 18+ 			1d4 rounds&lt;/pre&gt; 
If the subject doesn't attempt to escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.
 
On leaving the maze, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the maze spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears nearby.
 
Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
 
While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction to the extent that you no longer fit within it expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18).
 
At any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration runs out or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
 
The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18), in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, passwall expels you without damage.

There is no splash damage. For every three caster levels (maximum 18), the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round, dealing another 2d4 points of damage for that round. At 3rd-5th level, the acid lasts for 2 rounds; at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts for 3 rounds; and so on, to a maximum of 7 rounds at 18th level.

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or wineskin is completely healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands.

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature to be included in the spell effect. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all of the targeted creatures who are within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message, however, does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures who receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.
 
Note: To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing trained rogues the opportunity to read your lips.

  <Description>
Meteor swarm is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to fireball in many aspects. When you cast it, either four large spheres (2-foot-diameter) or eight small spheres (1-foot-diameter) spring from your outstretched hand and streak in a straight line to the spot you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
 
Any creature in the straight-line path of these spheres is struck by each one and takes 24d6 points of fire damage (no save).
 
If the spheres reach their destination, each bursts like a fireball in a spread.
 
Each large sphere deals 6d6 points of fire damage. The four spheres explode with their points of origin forming a diamond or box pattern around the spell's central point of origin, which you designate upon casting. Each large sphere has a 15-foot-radius spread, and each blast is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of the spell's effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.
 
The smaller spheres each have a 7 1/2-foot-radius spread, and each deals 3d6 points of fire damage. They explode with their points of origin forming a pattern around the spell's central point of origin (which you designated upon casting) of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides measuring 20 feet long. The center has four areas of overlapping effect, and numerous peripheral areas have two or three overlapping areas of the spell's effect.
 
Creatures caught in a blast can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. Creatures struck by multiple blasts save against each blast separately.

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about him. In the case of scrying that scans an area that the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

Mind fog produces a bank of fog that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the mind fog suffer a -10 competence penalty to all Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature who successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures suffer the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog itself is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).
 
The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

  <Description>
An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of up to 3rd level. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
 
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe. If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe. Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient light for vision, even though that part of the light spell volume in the globe would not be luminous.
 
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether minor globe of invulnerability stops it.

  <Description>
You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede. The DM then determines the particular effect of the miracle.
 
A miracle can do any of the following:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any cleric spell of up to 8th level         (including spells to which you have access because of         your domains).&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Duplicate any other spell of up to 7th level.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as         feeblemind or insanity.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Have any effect whose power level is in line with the         above effects.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it carries no experience point cost.
 
Alternatively, the cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. A request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.
 
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and SR as normal (but save DCs are for a 9th-level spell). When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.

As hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).

  <Description>
Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.
 
Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
 
Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack roll against a figment destroys it. A figment's AC is 10 + size modifier + Dexterity modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being struck by a fireball).
 
While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.
 
An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts her eyes, the spell has no effect, though being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded: In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (including detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, etc.). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds at his save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, etc. This spell does not affect other types of divination (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, etc.).

An illusory double of you (a figment) appears, and at the same time, you become invisible (as improved invisibility, a glamer). You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves according to your intent at the time of casting. You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed, can talk and gesture as if it were real, and even smells and feels real. The double cannot attack or cast spells, but it can pretend to do so.

  <Description>
You reach into the subject's mind and modify up to 5 minutes of her memory in one of the following ways:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually         experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, suggestion,         geas, quest, or similar spells.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an         event she actually experienced. For instance, she could         recall every word from a 5-minute conversation or every         detail from a passage in a book.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Change the details of an event the subject actually         experienced.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Implant a memory of an event the subject never         experienced.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
Casting the spell takes 1 action. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending up to 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.
 
A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts her natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much she enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that she ever saw you or your party. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and permanent magic items must make successful Will saves or be turned into normal items. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.
 
You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined.
 
Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must succeed at a Will save (DC 25) or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish.)
 
Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured. The phantom watchdog immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those already within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. It is stationary.
 
If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the watchdog, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. (For most defenders, the invisible creature gets a +2 attack bonus and the defender loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.) The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a +3 weapon for purposes of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
 
The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the watchdog, the spell ends.

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
 
You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion. There are two such servants for each caster level.
 
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Rest and relaxation within the place occurs as normal.

You bring into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round. Its attack bonus is your level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively) with a +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a crit of x2.
 
The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.
 
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC against touch attacks is 13.
 
If an attacked creature has SR, the resistance is checked the first time Mordenkainen's sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

Move earth moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, etc. However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
 
This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
 
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

  <Description>
The warded creature gains partial protection from undead creatures who use negative energy and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The negative energy protection spell uses positive energy, which can offset the effects of a negative energy attack. Each time the warded creature is struck by a negative energy attack that drains levels or ability scores, it rolls 1d20 + caster level against a DC of 11 + the attacker's HD.
 
If the warded creature succeeds, the energies cancel with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The warded creature takes only hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience levels or ability scores, regardless of the number of levels or ability score points the attack would have drained. An attacking undead creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy. An attacking caster or weapon receives no damage.
 
If the warded creature does not succeed, the negative energy attack deals its normal damage. An attacking undead creature in such a situation does not take any positive energy damage.

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature whom you name or otherwise specifically designate. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the subject tired out and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.
 
Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and stuns you for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil. While you are stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers get a +2 bonus against you.
 
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, the spell ends.
 
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail any saving throw, for example.)
 
Creatures who don't sleep or dream (such as elves, but not half-elves) are immune to this spell.

If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.
 
If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
 
Material Component: Worth 50 gp.

You make an item's aura register to detection spells (and similar spells) as though it were either a magic item of the type that you specify or the subject of a spell that you specify. You could make an ordinary sword register as a +2 vorpal sword as far as magical detection is concerned or make a +2 vorpal sword register as if it were a +1 sword.
 
If the object bearing Nystul's magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds at a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.
 
If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), Nystul's magic aura doesn't work.
 
Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has one-half concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
 
A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from the gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.
 
This spell does not function underwater.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures and dazes them for 1 round. A dazed creature can take no actions but suffers no penalties when attacked. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.
 
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Reflex save.

  <Description>
Otiluke's freezing sphere is a multipurpose spell. You can cast any one of the following three versions:
 
Frigid Sphere: A tiny sphere of freezing matter steaks from your fingertips to up to long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) to strike a body of water or a liquid that is principally water. When it strikes such a target, it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-foot square) per caster level. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. The sphere has no effect if it strikes a creature, even a water-based creature, but creatures swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 25) to do so.
 
Cold Ray: A ray of cold springs from your hand to close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The ray instantaneously deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
 
Globe of Cold: You create a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch but not harmful. This globe is a grenadelike weapon and can be hurled either as a thrown weapon (range increment 20 feet) or in a sling. The globe bursts on impact, dealing 6d6 points of cold damage instantaneously to all targets within a 10-foot radius. Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. If you do not hurl the globe, it bursts on its own after 1 round per caster level. You can command the globe to burst sooner if you wish, but the time cannot be changed once set (though it still bursts on impact after being hurled).

A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided it is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a wand of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the only effect that act produces is to move the sphere slightly. The globe can be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

  <Description>
As Otiluke's resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an Otiluke's telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs up to 5,000 pounds. The range of the telekinetic control extends to a maximum distance of medium range from you (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.
 
You move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh up to a total of 5,000 pounds by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere the round after casting the spell. A round's concentration (a standard action) moves the sphere up to 30 feet. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, the spell's duration ends, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.
 
Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only one-sixteenth of the actual weight, so the orb can be rolled without exceptional effort. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.
 
You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. If the wall's thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit if there is one or out the sole exit if there is only one.

This spell makes certain other spells permanent. Depending on the spell, you must be at least a minimum level and must expend a number of XP.
 
You can make these spells permanent in regard to yourself:
 &lt;pre&gt;Minimum  Spell 			Level 		XP Cost ----- 			------- 	-------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Comprehend languages 	9th 		500 XP Darkvision 		10th 		1,000 XP Detect magic 		9th 		500 XP Protection from arrows 	11th 		1,500 XP Read magic 		9th 		500 XP See invisibility 	10th 		1,000 XP Tongues 		11th 		1,500 XP&lt;/pre&gt; 
You cast the desired spell and then follow it with the permanency spell. You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a caster of greater level than you were when you cast the spell.
 
In addition to personal use, permanency can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature, or an object (as appropriate):
 &lt;pre&gt;Minimum  Spell 		Level 		XP Cost ----- 		------- 	-------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Enlarge 	9th 		500 XP Magic Fang 	9th 		500 XP Resistance 	9th 		250 XP&lt;/pre&gt; 
Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent:
 &lt;pre&gt;Minimum  Spell 			Level 		XP Cost ----- 			------- 	-------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Alarm 			9th 		500 XP Dancing lights 		9th 		500 XP Ghost sound 		9th 		500 XP Gust of wind 		11th 		1,500 XP Invisibility 		10th 		1,000 XP Magic mouth 		10th 		1,000 XP Phase door 		15th 		3,500 XP Prismatic sphere 	17th 		4,500 XP Shrink item 		11th 		1,500 XP Solid fog 		12th 		2,000 XP Stinking cloud 		11th 		1,500 XP Symbol 			16th 		4,000 XP Teleportation circle 	17th 		4,500 XP Wall of fire 		12th 		2,000 XP Wall of force 		13th 		2,500 XP Web 			10th 		1,000 XP&lt;/pre&gt; 
Spells cast on other creatures, objects, or locations (not on you) are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal.
 
The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that you never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of your research.

You conjure a quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and refuse to attack it. (Dire animals and nonintelligent creatures, such as vermin, can attack it.)
 
The mount has an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
 
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. Thus, the mount created by a 12th-level caster has the 8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities.
 
8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
 
10th Level: The mount can ride over water as if it were firm, dry ground.
 
12th Level: The mount can ride in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. The mount cannot simply take off and fly. It can only ride horizontally across the air. After 1 round in the air, the mount falls.
 
14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed. It has a maneuverability rating of average.

  <Description>
This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium-size or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Gems of true seeing and similar magic reveal the presence of a phase door but do not allow its use.
 
A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect.
 
A phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, up to eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time.

From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.
 
Note: Plane shift transports the creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

Plant growth has different effects depending on the version chosen.
 
Overgrowth: The first effect causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. (The DM may allow faster movement for very small or very large creatures.) The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect.
 
At your option, the area can be a circle with a radius of 100 feet, a semicircle with a radius of 150 feet, or a quarter circle with a radius of 200 feet. You may also designate areas within the area that are not affected.
 
Enrichment: The second effect targets plants within a range of one-half mile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal.
 
In many farming communities, clerics or druids cast this spell at planting time as part of the spring festivals.

  <Description>
As polymorph other, except this spell changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines:
 &lt;pre&gt;							Increase to Changed Subject Is: 					Duration Factor* ------------------- 					----------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral) 		+5 Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.) 		+2 Same size 						+2 Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) 	+2 Same or lower Intelligence 				+2&lt;/pre&gt; 
*Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table.
 &lt;pre&gt;Duration Factor 		Example			Duration --------	-------			--------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;0 		Pebble to human 	20 minutes 2 		Marionette to human 	1 hour 4 		Human to marionette 	3 hours 5 		Lizard to manticore 	12 hours 6 		Sheep to wool coat 	2 days 7 		Shrew to manticore 	1 week 9+ 		Manticore to shrew 	Permanent&lt;/pre&gt; 
Unlike polymorph other, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores of the new form.
 
As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.
 
Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers but does not add new powers except perhaps movement capabilities not present in the old form. A nonmagical object cannot be made magical by this spell. A magic item or weapon or other object can be polymorphed into another type of magic object, but it never gains abilities superior to those of the original object.
 
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, and platinum.
 
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of polymorph other, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute water to dust, or transmute rock to mud.

  <Description>
Polymorph other changes the subject into another form of creature. The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject's normal form. Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the creature further). If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.
 
The polymorphed creature acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, attack routines (claw, claw, and bite; swoop and rake; and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effects, etc.), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, etc.). Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not magical flight and other magical forms of travel, such as blink, dimension door, phase door, plane shift, teleport, and teleport without error. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of magical ability, so they are not granted by this spell. Other nonmagical abilities (such as an owl's low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.
 
Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.
 
The creature's new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which it has been transformed. You cannot, for example, turn someone into a mighty weight lifter to give the subject great Strength.
 
The subject retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The subject retains its own type (for example, "humanoid"), extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities. The subject can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components. The subject does not gain the spell-like abilities of its new form. The subject does not gain the supernatural abilities (such as breath weapons and gaze attacks) or the extraordinary abilities of the new creature.
 
The new form can be disorienting. Any time the polymorphed creature is in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or suffer a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes. Creatures who are polymorphed for a long time (years and years) grow accustomed to their new form and can overcome some of these drawbacks (DM's discretion).
 
When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature who does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the subject's equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.
 
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species. The subject can be changed into a member of its own species or even into itself. (If changed into itself, it does not suffer the abovementioned penalties from the disorientation of a new form.)
 
The subject is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
 
Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot be assumed, and incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed. A natural shapeshifter (a lycanthrope, doppelganger, experienced druid, etc.) can take its natural form as a standard action.

If power word, kill is cast as an area spell, it kills creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere. It kills only creatures who have 20 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 200 hit points of such creatures. The spell affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first until the next creature would put the total over the limit of 200.

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, the prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. Prestidigitations can slowly lift 1 pound of material. They can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. They can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. They cannot inflict damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
 
Characters typically use prestidigitations to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.

As prismatic wall, except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.
 
The sphere's blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 x 10 minutes.
 
You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, when you're inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures who attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.
 
Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.
 
The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall.

Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall---a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with fewer than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded (see blindness/deafness) for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.
 
The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
 
Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color. 
 
The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispelling cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.
 &lt;pre&gt;Color 	Order 	Effect of Color 				Negated By ----- 	----- 	--------------- 				----------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Red 	1st 	Stops nonmagical ranged weapons 		Cone of Cold 		Deals 20 ponts of fire damage (Reflex half) Orange 	2nd 	Stops magical ranged weapoins 			Gust of Wind 		Deals 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half) Yellow 	3rd 	Stops poisons, gasses, and petrification 		Disintegrate 		Deals 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half) Green 	4th 	Stops breath weapons 				Passwall 		Poison (Kills; Fortitute partial to take 20 points of damage instead) Blue 	5th 	Stops divination and mental attacks 		Magic Missile 		Turned to stone (Fortitude negates) Indigo 	6th 	Stops all spells 				Daylight 		Will save or become insane (as insanity spell) Violet 	7th 	Energy field destroys all objects and 		Dispel Magic effects 		Creatures are sent to another plane (Will negates)&lt;/pre&gt; 
The violet effect makes the special effects of the other six colors redundant, but they are included here because certain magic items can create prismatic effecs one color at a time, and SR might render some colors ineffective (see above).

Flames appear in your hand. You can hurl them or use them to touch enemies. The bright flames, which illuminate out to 20 feet as torches do, appear in your open hand and harm neither you nor your equipment.
 
You can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4 +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand.

As silent image, except this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.
 
You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See magic mouth for more details about such triggers.)
 
Material Component: Worth 25 gp.

You create a shadow duplicate of yourself; it looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The shadow mimics your actions (including speech) unless you concentrate on making it act differently. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn in a round you can switch from seeing through its eyes to seeing normally, or back again. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the shadow instead of from you. (The shadow is quasi-real, just real enough to cast spells that you originate.) The shadow can cast spells on itself only if those spells affect shadows.
 
You must maintain line of effect to the shadow at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/+1 against ranged weapons. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a ranged weapon, though a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus or any magical attack bypasses the reduction. The damage reduction increases with the caster level to 10/+2 at 5th, 10/+3 at 10th, 10/+4 at 15th, and 10/+5 at 20th. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

Note: Protection from elements overlaps (and does not stack with) resist elements and endure elements. If a character is warded by protection from elements and one or both of the other spells, the protection spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted. If a character is warded by resist elements and endure elements at the same time, the resist spell absorbs damage but the endure spell does not.

  <Description>
This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:
 
First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made by evil creatures.
 
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire's supernatural domination ability, which works similar to dominate person). The protection does not prevent a vampire's domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the protection from evil effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
 
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good elementals and outsiders are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

  <Description>
You create ten or more semitangible, visible magical orbs (called "eyes") that move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. When an eye returns, it relays what it has seen to you and then disappears. Each eye is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
 
The spell conjures 1d4 eyes plus one eye per caster level. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct that has 1 hit point, has AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and a +16 skill modifier on Hide checks. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
 
When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want the eyes to follow in a command of up to twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
 
In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind everything it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye only 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images.
 
If an eye ever gets more than one mile distant from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
 
The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if the eye is sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

Pyrotechnics turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose.
 
Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect blinds creatures within 120 feet of the fire source for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.
 
Smoke Cloud: The smoke is a writhing stream of smoke billowing out from the source and forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud suffer -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity scores (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the character leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.
 
Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

  <Description>
Quench is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels fire spells in the area, though you must succeed at a dispel check of 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Fire-based creatures within the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level from the spell (maximum 15d6, no save allowed).
 
Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame, such as a wand of fireball or a flame tongue sword. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities permanently unless it succeeds at a Will save. (Artifacts are immune to this effect.)

  <Description>
A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors captivates those within it. Rainbow pattern captivates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Affected creatures who fail their saves are captivated by the pattern. Captivated creatures cannot move away from the pattern, nor can they take actions other than to defend themselves. Thus, a captivated fighter cannot run away or attack but suffers no penalties when attacked. An attack on a captivated creature frees it from the spell immediately.
 
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All captivated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Captivated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), each captivated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.
 
The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

  <Description>
The cleric restores life to a deceased creature. The cleric can raise creatures who have been dead only up to 1 day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw. The subject loses a level (or 1 Constitution point, if she's 1st level) when raised.
 
Raise dead cures hit point damage up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
 
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.
 
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level to an energy-draining creature. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A character with spellcasting capacity (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given spell slot, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.

  <Description>
The enchanted creature is compelled to act randomly for 1 round. Rather than deciding its action for itself, the subject of the spell takes an action determined randomly on the following table:
 &lt;pre&gt;1d8	Action ---	------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;1 	Attack self (succeed on any roll other than a natural 1). 2 	Attack nearest being (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's "self"). 3 	Flee away from caster at top possible speed. 4 	Drop anything held. 5 	Stand motionless (as if stunned). 6 	Do nothing but defend (total defense). 7 	Speak (in the subject's native tongue, usually regarding surface thoughts) or make noises (if not capable of speech). 8 	Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible).&lt;/pre&gt; 
Nothing can affect this die roll in any way. It is always entirely random.

You prepare or retain additional spells. In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).
 
Pick one of these two versions:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Prepare: You prepare up to three additional levels of         spells (such as three 1st-level spells, a 2nd-level and a         1st-level spell, or a 3rd-level spell). A cantrip counts         as one-half level for these purposes. You prepare and         cast these spells normally.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;* Retain: You retain any spell up to 3rd level that you         had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the         mnemonic enhancer. This restores the previously cast         spell to your mind.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</Description>

You forge a telepathic bond among creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The bond can be established only among willing subjects, which therefore receive no saving throw or SR. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).
 
A wish spell can make a Rary's telepathic bond permanent, but it can bond only two people per wish.

By means of read magic, you can read magical inscriptions on objects---books, scrolls, weapons, and the like---that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a successful Spellcraft check against DC 13 or a symbol with a successful Spellcraft check against DC 19.

  <Description>
This spell causes instant diminution of a creature or object, decreasing its size and weight. Its height shrinks by up to 10% per caster level, to a maximum reduction of 50%. The reduced weight is proportional to the cube of the new height, as follows:
 &lt;pre&gt;Height Decrease	Weight Decrease ---------------	---------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;-10% (x 0.9) 	-30% (x 0.7) -20% (x 0.8) 	-50% (x 0.5) -30% (x 0.7) 	-60% (x 0.4) -40% (x 0.6) 	-80% (x 0.2) -50% (x 0.5) 	-90% (x 0.1)&lt;/pre&gt; 
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is reduced by the spell. Magical properties are not decreased by this spell---a smaller +3 sword is still +3, a smaller wand is still capable of its normal functions, and a smaller dose of a potion still has its normal effects. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a hurled stone would have less mass (and cause less damage), chains would be easier to burst, a rope made thinner and easier to sever, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but Strength decreases with size. For every 10% of reduction, a creature's Strength score suffers an enlargement penalty of -1, to a minimum score of 1.
 
A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but a reduced object shrinks only as long as the object itself is not damaged.
 
Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.
 
Reduce counters and dispels enlarge.

  <Description>
You create powerful magic in some specially prepared object---a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, etc. This object contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to an individual and at the same time inform him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to a maximum of 50 lb./level) are instantaneously transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject).
 
You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once deciding to alter the spell in this fashion you have no choice whether or not to be transported.
 
Material Component: Worth 1,500 gp.

  <Description>
With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process requires 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.
 
A character reincarnated recalls the majority of his former life and form. He retains his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any class abilities or skills he formerly possessed. His class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on his new body. First eliminate the character's racial adjustments (since he is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below. The character's level is reduced by 1. (If the character was 1st level, his new Constitution score is reduced by 1.)
 
It's quite possible for the change in the character's ability scores to make it difficult for him to pursue his previous character class. If this happens, the character is well advised to become a multiclass character.
 
The new incarnation is determined on the following table or by DM choice.
 &lt;pre&gt;d% 	Incarnation 	Str 	Dex 	Con -- 	----------- 	--- 	--- 	---&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;01-03 	Badger 		+4 	+8 	+4 04-09 	Bear, black 	+8 	+2 	+4 10-13 	Bear, brown 	+15 	+2 	+8 14-17 	Boar 		+4 	0 	+6 18-25 	Centaur 	+8 	+4 	+4 26-28 	Dryad 		0 	+4 	0 29-32 	Eagle 		0 	+4 	+2 33-42 	Elf 		0 	+2 	-2 43-46 	Gnome 		-2 	0 	+2 47-48 	Hawk 		-4 	+6 	0 49-58 	Halfling 	-2 	+2 	0 59-78 	Human 		0 	0 	0 79-80 	Leopard 	+6 	+8 	+4 81-82 	Owl 		-4 	+6 	0 83-85 	Pixie 		-4 	+8 	0 86-88 	Satyr 		0 	+2 	+2 89-90 	Sprite 		-4 	+6 	0 91-96 	Wolf 		+2 	+4 	+4 97-99 	Wolverine 	+10 	+8 	+8 100 	Other 		? 	? 	? 	(DM's choice)&lt;/pre&gt; 
Some bodies may make it impossible for the reincarnated character to use some of his class abilities. For example, a caster reincarnated as a hawk can't cast spells with somatic components because he doesn't have hands. The reincarnated character does gain any powers or abilities associated with his new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, etc. A humanoid reincarnated into an animal body can speak the languages it formerly knew and is a magical beast.
 
A wish spell can restore a reincarnated character to his original form.

Like repel wood, this spell creates waves of invisible and intangible energy that roll forth from you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.
 
Objects such as metal armor, swords, etc. are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal components are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects. 
 
The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After casting the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.

Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects (barrels, siege towers, etc.) are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. 
 
Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them. (A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can unlimber it as a move-equivalent action.) If a spear is planted (set) to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects.
 
The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After casting the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.

  <Description>
An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (up to the limit your level allows). Creatures within or entering the field must attempt saves. If they fail, they become unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back.) The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.

Note: Resist elements overlaps (and does not stack with) endure elements and protection from elements. If a character is warded by protection from elements and one or both of the other spells, the protection spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted. If a character is warded by resist elements and endure elements at the same time, the resist spell absorbs damage but the endure spell does not.

As lesser restoration, except the spell also dispels negative energy levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than 1 day per caster level. 
 
Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (caster's choice if more than one is drained).
 
Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

As raise dead, except you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a disintegrate spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.
 
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level (or 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level).
 
You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot revive someone who has died of old age.

This spell reverses gravity in the spell's area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within it to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
 
Provided there's something for them to hold onto, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to secure themselves when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces ("planes"). You and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find you. Climbing the rope counts as climbing a knotted rope, which requires a Climb check against DC 5. The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air. Pulling the rope free requires succeeding at a Strength check (DC 30).
 
Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.
 
Note: Creating an extradimensional space within or taking an extradimensional space into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.

You corrode iron and iron alloys at a touch. Any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius (a large iron door or a wall of iron), a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magical metal items are immune to this spell.
 
You may employ rusting grasp in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Rusting grasp used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (up to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion. For example, full plate armor (AC +8) could be reduced to +7 or as low as +2 in protection, depending on the die roll.
 
Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is instantaneously destroyed. Note: Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.
 
Against ferrous creatures, rusting grasp instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.

Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of the attacker's action is lost, and the attacker can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells (fireball, summon monster IV, etc.). While protected by this spell, the subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act. This allows a warded cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, summon creatures, cast a light spell in the area, and so on.

This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When the spell is cast, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
 
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. 
 
Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

You can see and hear some creature, who may be at any distance. You must succeed at a Scry check to do so. The difficulty of the task depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, you get a -5 penalty on the Scry check.
 &lt;pre&gt;Knowledge 					DC --------- 					--&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;None* 						20 Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) 	15 Firsthand (you have met the subject) 		10 Familiar (you know the subject well) 		5&lt;/pre&gt; 
*You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. 
 &lt;pre&gt;Connection 					Scry Check Bonus ---------- 					----------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Likeness or picture 				+5 Possession or garment 				+8 Body part, lock of hair, nail clippings, etc. 	+10&lt;/pre&gt; 
This spell creates a magical sensor located near the subject. Any creature with Intelligence 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a Scry check (or an Intelligence check) against DC 20.
 
The following spells can be cast through a scrying spell: comprehend languages, read magic, tongues, and darkvision. The following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating correctly: detect magic, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, and message.

You change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where none exist (such as making trees sing), deaden sounds (such as making a party of adventurers silent), or transform sounds into other sounds (such as making a caster's voice sound like a pig snorting). All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it.
 
You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself. For instance, you can't change your voice so that it sounds as though you are giving the command word to activate a magic item unless you know that command word.
 
A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically (such as into that of the aforementioned snorting pig) is unable to cast spells with verbal components.

Secret page alters the actual contents of a page so that they appear to be something entirely different. Thus, a map can be changed to become a treatise on burnishing ebony walking sticks. The text of a spell can be changed to show a ledger page or even another spell. Explosive runes or sepia snake sigil can be cast upon the secret page.
 
A comprehend languages spell alone cannot reveal the secret page's contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word, perusing the actual page, and then returning it to its secret page form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A detect magic spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. True seeing reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with comprehend languages. Secret page can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an erase spell.

  <Description>
When you cast sepia snake sigil, a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book, scroll, or map. When this symbol is read, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes at the nearest living creature (but does not attack you). The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days +1 day per caster level have elapsed.
 
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. He is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of his surroundings. He can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides him with no protection against physical injury. However, if he is reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, he does not lose hit points or stabilize until the spell ends.
 
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.

  <Description>
When cast, this spell not only prevents divination spells from working to detect or locate the creature or object affected by sequester, it also renders the affected creature or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing. Thus, sequester can mask a secret door, a treasure vault, etc. The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices (such as a robe of eyes or a gem of seeing). Living creatures (and even undead creatures) affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.
 
Note: The Will save prevents a character from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

  <Description>
You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
 
All those that interact with the conjured object, force, or creature can make Will saves to recognize its shadowy nature. Those who succeed do so.
 
Attack spells, such as flame arrow, have normal effects unless those affected succeed at Will saves. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Mimicked spells allow the normal saves and SR.
 
Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mists, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are one-fifth strength or 20% likely to work. For instance, a shadow obscuring mist only provides one-half concealment at 25 feet, not 5 feet.
 
Shadow creatures have one-fifth the normal hit points (regardless of whether they're recognized as shadowy). They deal normal damage and have all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature who recognizes them as shadowy, however, such a creature's damage is one-fifth normal, and all special abilities that do not produce normal damage (in hit points) are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 total bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).
 
Those who succeed at their saves see the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.

  <Description>
You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a wizard or sorcerer evocation of 4th level or lower. (For a spell with more than one level, use the best one applicable to you.) For example, this spell can be magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, or so on. If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth normal damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, affected creatures are also allowed any save the spell being simulated allows, but set the save DC according to shadow magic's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level. Nondamaging effects (such as web's ensnarement) have no effect when the shadow magic is recognized as mostly illusory.

  <Description>
To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of heavy shadows. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
 
In the region of shadow, you can move at a rate of up to seven miles every 10 minutes, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, a character can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. You know where you will come out on the Material Plane.
 
Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this requires the potentially perilous transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
 
Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

Shambler creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds of 11 HD. (See the Monster Manual for details about shambling mounds.) The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared.
 
The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain is rainy, marshy, or damp.

As polymorph other, except this spell enables you to assume the form of any single creature of less than deity status (including unique dragon types, or the like) or any single object. The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension. Unlike polymorph other, this spell allows incorporeal forms to be assumed.
 
Your new form works like a polymorph other form. You still do not gain the supernatural or spell-like abilities of your new form, though you do gain its extraordinary abilities while keeping your own. You also gain the type of the new form (for example, "dragon" or "magical beast") in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original forms. Thus, a new form's poison bite is effective.
 
You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. 
 
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get +10 on your Disguise check.

Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that shatters brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.
 
Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, and so forth. All such objects within a 3-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.
 
Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level.
 
Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

Shield creates an invisible, mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk also intercepts attacks, providing three-quarters cover (+7 AC and +3 on Reflex saves against attacks that affect an area). The disk moves out of the way when you attack, so it does not provide cover to opponents. The disk protects you only against magic missiles and attacks from one direction. You designate half the battlefield (with yourself on the dividing line) as being blocked by the shield. The other half is not. You can change the defensive direction of the shield (that is, rotate the dividing line) once as a free action on each of your turns.

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and slowing chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects:
 
First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus to saves. Unlike protection from chaos, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.
 
Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.
 
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from chaos does.
 
Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is slowed (Will save negates, as the slow spell, but against shield of law's save DC).

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of the subject's wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus to saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those inflicted by special abilities) that deal it hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.
 
If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 2d6 points of damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Crystalline creatures are allowed Fortitude saves to reduce the damage by half, and creatures holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with successful Reflex saves.
 
A deaf character, in addition to the obvious effects, suffers a -4 penalty on initiative and a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that he tries to cast.

You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to one-twelfth of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/2,000th the original volume and mass). Optionally, you can also change its now-shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
 
If shrink item is made permanent (see the permanency spell), the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use SR, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive saves and SR, and unattended objects and points in space do not.

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.

  <Description>
Simulacrum creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. The duplicate appears to be exactly the same as the original, but there are differences: The simulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50%+1d10%) of the hit points, knowledge (including level, skills, and speech), and personality of the real creature. Creatures familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.
 
At all times the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 1 day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to the simulacrum.

  <Description>
A sleep spell causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Roll 2d4 to determine how many total HD of creatures can be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. No creature with 5 or more HD is affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
 
Creatures with fewer HD are affected first. 
 
Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
 
Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
 
Note: Extra hit points are irrelevant for determining how many HD a creature has. An ogre with 4d8+8 hit points still has only 4 HD and can be affected by the spell.

  <Description>
This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Search check for a rogue [only] to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. (Note that the head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared.)
 
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, causing no damage but tightly binding it.
 
An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the snare is anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, he can move at half speed, but can't run or charge. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by this spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell.
 
The snare is magical. To escape, the trapped creature must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 23) or a Strength check (DC 23) that is a full-round action. The snare has 5 hit points and AC 7. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

  <Description>
When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM's option). Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.
 
Creatures in mud must succeed at Reflex saves or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. Creatures who succeed at their saves can move through the mud at half speed, and they can't run or charge.
 
Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area are reduced to half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.
 
Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or the wall or roof and falls.
 
A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

As fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at one-tenth normal speed, and all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that the creature or objects passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.
 
Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through clone, raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, or even a miracle or a wish.

Deafened creatures are not stunned but are still damaged.

  <Description>
You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask up to one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
 
If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
 
This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned. 
 
Any corpse that has been turned into an undead creature can't be spoken to with speak with dead.

  <Description>
A ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell that you cast of 4th level or lower can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives you a +2 bonus to your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand can flank targets like a creature can. If the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the hand returns to you and hovers.
 
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (one-half damage on a failed save against an area spell and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable SR regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that spell immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which SR doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect.
 
A creature can have only one spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.

Spells (and spell-like effects) targeted against you rebound on the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to affect touch range spells.
 
From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. Each spell turned subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left.
 
A spell might be only partially turned. Subtract the 1d4+6 result from the spell level of the incoming spell. Divide the remaining levels of the incoming spell by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected.
 
If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result:
 &lt;pre&gt;d% 	Effect -- 	------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;01-70 	Spell drains away without effect. 71-80 	Spell affects both of you equally at full effect. 81-97 	Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes. 98-100 	Both of you go through a rift into another plane.&lt;/pre&gt;</Description>

  <Description>
Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.
 
Any creature who sustains damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its speed by one-third. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding at a Heal check against the spell's save DC.
 
Spike growth is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shapes themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background. The spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d8 points of damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. In addition, ground speed through the spell's area is reduced by half.

  <Description>
A melee weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 damage per hit. The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. It uses your base attack bonus as its attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds). It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.
 
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. The spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or damaged.
 
If an attacked creature has SR, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

  <Description>
A statue spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points.
 
The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage.
 
The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.

  <Description>
When a cleric needs to keep track of comrades that may get separated, status allows him to mentally monitor their relative position and general condition. The cleric is aware of direction and distance to the creatures and their status: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, etc. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If they leave it, the spell ceases to function for them.

Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud are nauseated (Fortitude negates), making them unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, and so on. The only action a nauseated character can take is a single move (or move-equivalent action) per turn. These effects last as long as the character is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after he or she leaves the cloud. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Those who succeed at their saves but remain in the cloud must continue to save each round.

You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, you can make a stone weapon, a special trapdoor, or a crude idol. Stone shape also permits you to reshape a stone door to make an exit where one didn't exist or to seal a door shut. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone shape, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
 
The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction 10/+5. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage, though a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus or any magical attack bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

  <Description>
This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. Creatures beneath the cloud must succeed at Fortitude saves or be deafened (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4x10 minutes.
 
If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn.
 
Second Round: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. No save is allowed.
 
Third Round: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. All may be directed at a single target, or they may be directed at up to six separate targets. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures struck can attempt Reflex saves for half damage.
 
Fourth Round: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save).
 
Fifth through Tenth Rounds: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters. Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds at a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of vengeance's save + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

  <Description>
You influence the actions of the enchanted creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
 
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.
 
A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM.

This spell summons an outsider (extraplanar creature) that attacks your enemies. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the outsider, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. Summoned creatures act normally on the last round of the spell and disappear at the end of their turn.
 
Choose a 1st-level monster from the Summon Monster table.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a dire rat.

  <Description>
A swarm of little creatures carpets the effect's area, viciously attacking all other creatures there. (Roll on the table below to see what sort of creature is summoned.) A creature in the swarm who takes no actions other than fighting off the creatures takes 1 point of damage on its turn. A creature in the swarm who takes any other action, including leaving the swarm, takes 1d4 points of damage +1 point per three caster levels. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the swarm is impossible.
 &lt;pre&gt;1d20	Swarm Type* ----	-----------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;1-8 	Rats (animals) 9-14 	Bats (animals) 15-16 	Spiders (vermin, poisonous) 17-18 	Centipedes (vermin, poisonous) 19-20 	Flying beetles (vermin)&lt;/pre&gt; 
*The creature types (in parentheses) indicate what sorts of spells and effects might aid a subject against the swarm.
 
A swarm of poisonous creatures deals no damage to creatures who are immune to poison, though it still prevents spellcasting and concentration. The creatures' attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction, being incorporeal, and other special abilities also make a creature immune to damage from the swarm.
 
The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and damaging area effects can force it to disperse. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points of damage per caster level from these attacks. Certain area or effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately if appropriate to the swarm summoned. (For example, only fliers are affected by a gust of wind.)
 
The swarm is stationary once summoned. A druid caster, however, can (as a move-equivalent action) direct the swarm to move up to 30 feet per round (or 90 feet per round if she has summoned bats or beetles).

For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intensely hot light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is exhausted.
 
All creatures in the beam are blinded and take 3d6 points of damage. (A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.) In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills. Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double damage.
 
Undead creatures caught within the ray are dealt 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the ray results in the destruction of undead creatures specifically affected by sunlight if they fail their saves.
 
The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, slimes, jellies, puddings, and fungoid creatures just as if they were undead creatures.

  <Description>
This spell allows you to scribe any of the potent runes described below. A symbol can be quickly scribed in the air or on some surface. Alternatively, you can carefully inscribe it on a surface. The symbol harms those who trigger it (usually those who pass over it, touch it, read it, etc.)
 
A quickly scribed symbol has a casting time of 1 action. The resulting rune becomes active immediately. It lasts 10 minutes per caster level and glows faintly while it lasts. Symbols of fear, hopelessness, pain, or persuasion can be used in this manner. Symbols of death, discord, insanity, pain, sleep, and stunning cannot.
 
A carefully engraved symbol has a casting time of 10 minutes. The symbol is inactive when finished and remains so until triggered. Once triggered, it becomes active and glows, usually lasting 10 minutes per caster level. Some symbols can last indefinitely once triggered. For example, a symbol of death ends when it has slain 150 hit points worth of creatures.
 
To be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective.
 
As a default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: reads, touches, or passes over the rune, looks at the rune, or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
 
In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To trigger a symbol, a creature must be within 60 feet of the rune.
 
You can set special triggering conditions of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. For example, a symbol can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.
 
A symbol's triggering conditions must always be defensive in nature. A touch-triggered symbol remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
 
Once the spell is cast, a symbol's triggering conditions cannot be changed.
 
You ignore the effects of your own symbols and cannot inadvertently trigger them. When scribing a symbol quickly, you can instantly attune any number of creatures to the symbol, rending them immune to its effects, provided the creatures are within 60 feet of the rune when it is created and that you are aware of their presence.
 
When creating a carefully inscribed symbol, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (up to ten creatures) takes 1 hour. Attuning a large group (up to twenty-five creatures) takes 1 day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.
 
When triggered, a symbol affects all creatures within a 60-foot radius except for you and any individuals attuned to it. If a symbol has a password, anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the character remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, he must use the password again. Once triggered, a symbol remains active until its duration expires. Creatures who subsequently meet an active symbol's triggering conditions suffer its effects.
 
A successful dispel magic removes the effects of a symbol from a creature unless the symbol's effect is instantaneous (death, stunning) or the description specifies another remedy (insanity). The rune itself can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol. Destruction of the surface where a symbol rests destroys the symbol but also triggers its effects.
 
Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 19). Identifying the symbol does not discharge it and allows you to know the version of the symbol.
 
A symbol can be rendered permanent with the permanency spell, provided it is carefully engraved upon a permanent, nonportable surface such as a wall or door. A permanency spell extends a symbol's basic duration of 10 minutes per caster level indefinitely. When triggered, a permanent symbol usually glows and is active for about 10 minutes, but there is no limit to how many times it can be triggered. If the symbol can affect only a limited number of hit points worth of creatures, the limit applies each 10 minutes. For example, a permanent symbol of death could slay 150 hit points worth of creatures every 10 minutes.
 
Known symbols include:
 
Death: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, must succeed at Fortitude saves or die. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures.
 
Discord: All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Fear: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. Creatures within the radius are afflicted by a powerful version of the fear spell. If scribed in the air, this symbol requires a Will save to resist. If the rune is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Hopelessness: All creatures within the radius must attempt Will saves. If the rune is carefully engraved on a surface, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4x10 minutes and submits to simple demands from foes, such as to surrender or get out. The effect is similar to that of the suggestion spell. If no foes are present to make demands, there is a 25% chance that a hopeless creature proves unable to take any action except hold its ground. If the creature remains free to act, there is a 25% chance it retreats from the rune at normal speed. In either case, the creature can defend normally if attacked. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Insanity: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, become insane (as the insanity spell; Will negates). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Pain: Creatures within the radius suffer wracking pains that reduce Dexterity scores by 2 and impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (Fortitude negates). Both effects last 2d10x10 minutes. This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. If carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level.
 
Persuasion: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. All creatures within the radius must succeed at Will saves to resist. If the symbol is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature becomes the same alignment as you for 1d20 x 10 minutes. During this time, affected creatures become friendly to you as though subjected to charm person. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Sleep: Creatures within the radius fall into a catatonic slumber if they have 8 or fewer HD (Will negates). Sleeping creatures cannot be awakened for 3d6x10 minutes. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
 
Stunning: One or more creatures within the radius whose total hit points do not exceed 250 become stunned (Fortitude negates). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it. In addition, the stunned creatures drop what they are holding. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.

  <Description>
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific type of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically---for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Larger groups, such as "goblinoids," are not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named---for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or true neutral.
 
Creatures of the type or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.
 
Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.

Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower are not affected. A creature whose type (such as humanoid or dragon) is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well.

  <Description>
You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust.
 
Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 25 pounds per caster level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with SR.
 
This version of the spell lasts up to 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
 
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.
 
Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. You can hurl one or more objects or creatures who are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level.
 
You must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).
 
Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

  <Description>
This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is SR applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and SR.
 
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
 
Note: Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.
 
To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. 
 &lt;pre&gt;			On 		Off 		Similar Familiarity 		Target 		Target 		Area 		Mishap ----------- 		------ 		------ 		------- 	------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Very familiar 		01-97 		98-99 		100 		--- Studied carefully 	01-94 		95-97 		98-99 		100 Seen casually 		01-88 		89-94 		95-98 		99-100 Viewed once 		01-76 		77-88 		89-96 		97-100 Description 		01-52 		53-76 		77-92 		93-100 False destination 	(1d20+80) 	--- --- 		81-92 		93-100&lt;/pre&gt; 
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
 
Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you've been there often or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps even from a precise map.
 
"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
 
On Target: You appear where you want to be.
 
Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, etc. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
 
Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up somewhere else across the globe.
 
Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as teleport without error, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.
 
The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way, such as by placing it on a raised platform.

You must succeed at a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed by a successful dispel magic spell.

  <Description>
You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range (by moving too fast or by such means as a teleport spell) or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

You can't cast spells, even from magic items.
 
You gain 1d6 temporary hit points per caster level, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +2d4 Strength enhancement bonus, a +2d4 Dexterity enhancement bonus, a +1 base attack bonus per two caster levels (which may give you an extra attack), a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. You attack opponents with melee or ranged weapons if you can, even resorting to unarmed attacks if that's all you can do.

This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; however, you can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when the time stop spell ends. (The spells' durations do not begin until the time stop is over.)
 
You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.
 
You are undetectable while time stop lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an antimagic field, or by protection from chaos/evil/good/law, or by a magic circle spell, while under the effects of time stop.

This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. Naturally, the subject can speak only one language at a time, although she may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can make herself understood as far as her voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way.

This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. Magic objects made of metal effectively have SR 20 + caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood suffer a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls. Armor converted from metal to wood loses 2 points of AC bonus. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of AC bonus every time it is struck by a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.
 
Only a limited wish, miracle, or wish or similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state. Otherwise, for example, a metal door changed to wood is forevermore a wooden door.

This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink until hip- or chest-deep, reducing their speed to 5 feet and giving them -2 penalties on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
 
If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud. Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed at Reflex saves.
 
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effects of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
 
The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance---but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

You can enter any normal plant (Medium-size or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same species in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance ("an oak tree one hundred miles due north of here"), and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired (the oak tree outside your druid grove, for instance), but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.
 
This spell does not function with plant creatures such as shambling mounds and treants.
 
The destruction of an occupied plant slays you.

  <Description>
Trap the soul forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem.
 
The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
 
Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
 
Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows SR (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any SR is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or SR is successful, the gem shatters.
 
Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of SR or a save.

By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a small, living tree or shrub or a large, dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and saves remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 1. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.
 
You can dismiss tree shape as a free action.

You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same type, must all be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range shown in the following table:
 &lt;pre&gt;Type of Tree		Range of Transport ------------		------------------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Oak, ash, yew 		3,000 feet Elm, linden 		2,000 feet Other deciduous 	1,500 feet Any coniferous 		1,000 feet All other trees 	500 feet&lt;/pre&gt; 
You may move into a tree up to one time per level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration is expended or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.
 
You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, though you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

As raise dead, except the cleric can resurrect a creature who has been dead up to 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been wholly destroyed, provided you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method).
 
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution point) or prepared spells.
 
You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed.
 
Even true resurrection can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age.

You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus her vision to see into the Ethereal Plane. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.
 
True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not cancel concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.
 
Additionally, the divine version of this spell allows the subject to see auras, noting alignments of creatures at a glance.

Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
 
First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect.
 
Second, all turning checks to turn undead suffer a -4 profane penalty and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (Note: This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)
 
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallow site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire consecrated site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a curse effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again.
 
Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallow site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, negative energy protection, protection from elements, remove fear, resist elements, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
 
An area can receive only one unhallow (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
 
Unhallow counters and dispels hallow.

A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects:
 
First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus to saves. Unlike the effect of protection from good, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.
 
Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.
 
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from good does.
 
Finally, if a good creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage (Fortitude save negates).

You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying cloud of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.
 
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to good creatures and sickens them for 1d4 rounds. A sickened creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage to half and negates the sickening effect.
 
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Reflex save.

  <Description>
The unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command the servant to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, and that is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. Its speed is 15 feet.
 
The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

You must succeed at a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you inflict. However, you can't gain more than the subject's current hit points +10, which is enough to kill the subject. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.

As teleport, except it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces (such as a delayed blast fireball bead) cannot be made to vanish. There is a 1% chance that a vanished item is disintegrated instead.
 
If desired, a vanished object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object vanished remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. A party might be made to resemble a mixed band of brownies, pixies, and faeries led by a treant. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed at a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check.
 
Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with SR. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but SR doesn't help.

As legend lore, except vision works more quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it with a successful Scry check (DC 10). If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 15, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 20, and the information gained is vague.

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.
 
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a successful Reflex save. (If the creature ends up on the hot side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.)
 
If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.)

A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall of force cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is totally unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, and Mordenkainen's disjunction. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through the wall of force.
 
The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level, or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level.
 
The wall of force must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.

  <Description>
This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Fire, including fireball and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice. It deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage suffered by objects). Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
 
Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
 
The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
 
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level.
 
Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. It is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.
 
You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures can avoid being trapped by the hemisphere by making successful Reflex saves.

You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
 
The wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but it is so hard that the first 10 points of damage from each blow are ignored. (For example, a blow of 17 points of damage deals only 7 to the wall.) A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
 
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 40) to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Large and smaller creatures who fail take 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. 
 
Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents. The wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
 
Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create a span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
 
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by disintegrate or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but the wall is so hard that the first 8 points of damage from each blow are ignored. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
 
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through the wall of thorns takes 25 points of damage per round of movement, minus 1 point for each point of the creature's AC. Dexterity bonuses to AC and dodge bonuses do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher take no damage from contact with the wall.)
 
You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to caster level x2. This has no effect on the damage inflicted by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
 
Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall. To make any progress, a creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 20). A successful creature moves a number of feet equal to its Strength check result minus 19, so a creature who rolled 24 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
 
Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at their normal speed without taking damage.
 
A wall of thorns can be carefully breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns away the barrier in 10 minutes.

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. At 1st level, you can warp a handaxe handle or ten crossbow bolts. At 3rd level, you can warp the shaft of a typical shortspear. Boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. Warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls.
 
Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. Make whole, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points---floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.---or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers.
 
An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell.
 
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the webs and is free to act, though moving may be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding at a Strength check (DC 20) or an Escape Artist check (DC 25). Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
 
The web provides one-quarter cover for every 5 feet of the substance between you and an opponent---one-half cover for 10 feet of web, three-quarters for 15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more.
 
The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire---a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, etc.---can set them alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames.

As phantasmal killer, except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.
 
If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, the subject still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject's Strength score also drops 1d4 points for 10 minutes. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it.

  <Description>
This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The whirlwind always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds---possibly endangering you or your allies---and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.)
 
Any Large or smaller creature who comes in contact with the whirlwind must succeed at a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. Medium-size or smaller creatures who fail their first save must succeed at a second one or be picked up bodily by the whirlwind and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released.

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. (It can't pass through walls, for instance.) The whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as one mile per hour or as quickly as one mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
 
A magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) or as slow as 5 feet per round (1/2 mph), as the walker wills. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, etc.
 
A wind walker can regain her physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form requires 5 rounds. You, however, may dismiss the spell, ending it immediately. You may even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. While in vaporous form, subjects gain damage reduction 20/+1, though they may sustain damage from high winds (as determined by the DM). No spellcasting is possible in vaporous form.
 
For the last minute of the spell, a wind walker automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though she may descend faster if she wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall suffers a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).
 
While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, which is sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits.
 
A wish can do any one of the following:
 &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or         lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited         to you.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided         the spell is not from a school prohibited to you.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or         lower even if it's from a prohibited school.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if         it's from a prohibited school.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as         geas/quest or insanity.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Create a valuable item, even a magic item, of up to         15,000 gp in value.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score.         Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can         grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability         score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3         inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are         instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An         inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability         score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score         do not stack, so only the best one applies.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid         one creature per caster level, and all subjects must be         cured of the same type of affliction. For example, you         could heal all the damage your party has suffered, or         remove all the poison effects from the party, but not do         both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the         experience point loss from casting a spell or the level         or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to         life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can         revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but         the feat takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and         another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot         prevent a character who was brought back to life from         losing an experience level.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per         caster level from anywhere on any plane and place these         creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local         conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to         negate and SR.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event.         The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last         round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself         to accommodate the new result. For example, the wish         could undo an opponent's successful save, a         foe's successful critical hit (either the attack         roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save,         and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse         than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will         save to negate and SR.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
You may wish for greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives you the opportunity to fulfill your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)
 
Duplicated spells allow saves and SR as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.

Wood shape enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, you can make a wooden weapon, fashion a special trapdoor, or sculpt a crude idol. This spell also permits you to reshape a wood door to make an exit where one didn't exist or to seal a door shut. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.

Uttering word of chaos creates two effects:
 
If you are on your home plane, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the word of chaos.
 
Creatures native to your plane who hear the word of chaos and are not chaotic suffer the following ill effects:
 &lt;pre&gt;HD		Effect --		------&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;12 or more 	Deafened Less than 12 	Stunned, deafened Less than 8 	Confused, stunned, deafened Less than 4 	Killed, confused, stunned, deafened&lt;/pre&gt; 
The effects are cumulative.
 
Deafened: The creature is struck deaf (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4 rounds.
 
Stunned: The creature is stunned for 1 round. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it.
 
Confused: The creature is confused, as by the confusion spell, for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment.
 
Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, objects and creatures weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a 15th-level cleric could transport his person and objects or creatures weighing an additional 750 pounds. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
 
An unwilling creature can't be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or SR) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.

Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Creatures are allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when they first enter the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
